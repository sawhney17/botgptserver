            "text": "A Doll's House\n \n \tINTRODUCTION\nBRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF HENRIK IBSEN\nHenrik Ibsen was born into into a wealthy family in Skien, Norway in 1828. After failing his university entrance exams, he decided he\u2019d rather focus on writing than pursue higher education. When he first began to write, though, he was quite unsuccessful, rendering him and his wife extremely poor. In 1864 he left his wife and his five-year-old son, Sigurd (who grew up to become the Prime Minister of Norway) and moved to Sorrento, Italy. He later moved to Dresden, Germany, where he wrote his most famous play, A Doll\u2019s House. After his initial unsuccessful years, Ibsen became more popular as a writer, even if his plays were thought of as scandalous and inappropriate. He returned to Norway in 1891 and died in Oslo in 1906 after suffering several strokes. He is now one of the world\u2019s most famous playwrights, and his work is performed more often than that of any other playwright except Shakespeare. He is often considered to be \u201cthe father of realism\u201d in drama, and is also thought of as a pioneer of Modernism.\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\nThe 1870s were dominated by strict Victorian social codes and laws that severely restricted the rights of all women, and married women in particular. Governments throughout Europe used the Napoleonic Code, which prevented women from engaging in financial transactions. Many women who conducted their own business or earned their own wages chose not to marry because the laws regarding what married women could do when it came to finances were so limiting. By the beginning of the 20th century, things were beginning to change as the female suffrage movement swept over Europe and the world and women were awarded rights such as the right to own property and the right to vote. However, for most people in the late 1870s, such eventualities were not yet even a distant dream.\nRELATED LITERARY WORKS\nAnother significant playwright working in the realist tradition was the Russian writer Anton Chekhov, whose plays also provide a critical examination of family, society, and morality. The Swedish playwright August Strindberg was influenced by Ibsen; Strindberg\u2019s plays are in the naturalist style, a theatrical movement that grew out of and responded to realism.\nKEY FACTS\n\u2022\tFull Title: A Doll\u2019s House (Norwegian: Ett dukkehjem)\n\u2022\tWhen Written: 1879\n\u2022\tWhere Written: Dresden, Germany\n\u2022\tWhen Published: Published and first performed in December 1879\n\u2022\tLiterary Period: Realism; modernism\n\u2022\tGenre: Realist modern prose drama\n\u2022\tSetting: A town or city in Norway\n\u2022\tClimax: When Torvald discovers the letter from Krogstad revealing Nora\u2019s secret\n\u2022\tAntagonist: At first Krogstad, then Torvald\nEXTRA CREDIT\nA True Story: A Doll\u2019s House is based on the life of Ibsen\u2019s family friend Laura Kieler, whose actions inspired the story of Nora\u2019s secret debt. In reality, however, Kieler did not forge a signature, and when her husband, Victor, discovered her secret, he divorced her and forced her to be committed to an insane asylum. Ibsen, appalled by Kieler\u2019s committal, wrote A Doll\u2019s House in part as a way of defending her. After two years in the asylum Kieler returned to live with her husband and children and became a famous author in Denmark.\nScandalous: When it was first performed and for many years afterwards, A Doll\u2019s House caused quite the scandal for its criticism of 19th-century marriage customs and portrayal of a woman abandoning her family in order to gain a sense of self. Pressured by several theatres and even the actress who was supposed to play Nora in a German production of the play, Ibsen wrote an alternative ending, in which Nora, upon seeing her children, changes her mind and stays with Torvald. He later regretted doing this, calling the adapted ending \u201ca barbaric outrage.\u201d\n \tPLOT SUMMARY\nNora Helmer, a young woman, enters her house carrying packages. It is Christmas Eve, and a porter delivers a Christmas tree. Nora\u2019s husband, Torvald, emerges from his study and greets her. She shows off the Christmas gifts she has bought for their children, and although Torvald chastises her for spending too much, he is also very affectionate towards her, calling her his \u201clittle skylark\u201d and \u201clittle squirrel.\u201d The two of them celebrate the fact that Torvald has recently been promoted to Bank Manager, meaning they can have a more comfortable life. Mrs. Linde and Dr. Rank arrive. Dr. Rank and Torvald exit to talk in his study. Mrs. Linde, who hasn\u2019t seen Nora for eight years, tells her that she had an unhappy marriage and is now a widow hoping to find a job. Nora promises her that she will ask Torvald to give her a job. Nora then reveals a secret she has been hiding: when she and Torvald were first married, she borrowed money in order to finance a trip to Italy that was necessary to save Torvald\u2019s life, as he had grown ill. She has paid off the debt in installments, secretly taking jobs and saving money from her allowance from Torvald.\nNils Krogstad, an employee at the bank, arrives and talks to Torvald in Torvald\u2019s study. Dr. Rank comes out to talk to Nora and says that Krogstad is morally corrupt. Torvald enters, and after a brief conversation with Mrs. Linde, says he can give her a job at the bank. Torvald, Mrs. Linde, and Dr. Rank exit, and Nora plays happily with her children. Krogstad enters, and Nora tells the children to go to their nursemaid and not tell anyone about Krogstad\u2019s visit. It is revealed that Krogstad is the person who Nora borrowed money from. He explains that he is being fired by Torvald, and that Nora must stop this happening or else Krogstad will tell everyone her secret. He adds that he has evidence that Nora forged her father\u2019s signature in an IOU. Krogstad exits, and Torvald returns. Nora tries to persuade him not to fire Krogstad, but is unable to.\nAct Two begins the next day, on Christmas Day. Nora, alone on stage, worries about her fate. Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora sew her costume for a fancy dress ball that is being held on Boxing Day. Nora is dressing as an Italian fisher girl and plans on dancing the tarantella. Mrs. Linde asks to know more about Nora\u2019s secret, but Nora refuses to tell her anything for the moment. Torvald enters and Nora tries again to convince him not to fire Krogstad. However, the harder Nora tries, the angrier Torvald gets, and he eventually decides to send Krogstad\u2019s notice immediately.\nDr. Rank arrives and is depressed, telling Nora he will die soon. She flirts with him and seems to be considering whether to ask him for money. He reveals that he is in love with her, and Nora gives up the idea of asking him for help. Dr. Rank leaves and Krogstad returns, asking if Nora had told Torvald her secret and telling her his ambition to eventually run the bank. He leaves a letter explaining the secret debt and forgery in Torvald\u2019s letterbox and exits. Mrs. Linde returns and Nora explains the situation to her. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that she and Krogstad used to be in love, and asks that Nora distract Torvald while Mrs. Linde attempts to talk to Krogstad. Mrs. Linde leaves, and Nora begs Torvald to help her rehearse the tarantella. She dances in a crazed, uninhibited way, puzzling Torvald about what has gotten into her. Mrs. Linde returns, saying Krogstad was not in but that she left him a note. The Act ends with Nora declaring that she has thirty-one hours left to live.\nAct Three opens on the next day. Krogstad comes to meet Mrs.\nLinde at the Helmers\u2019 house while they are at the ball. It is revealed that the two of them once loved each other but that their relationship ended when Mrs. Linde chose to marry a richer man because that was the only way to support her family. Mrs. Linde suggests that, now that their respective spouses have both died, she and Krogstad marry so that she can take care of his children and they can live a happier life together. Krogstad is thrilled, and offers to ask for his letter to Torvald back, as he now regrets his earlier actions. Mrs. Linde, however, tells him to leave it, saying that the truth must come out.\nKrogstad leaves, and Nora and Torvald return from the ball. Mrs. Linde urges Nora to tell her husband the truth, and then she leaves as well. Torvald tells Nora how much he desires her, but Nora stubbornly resists his advances. Dr. Rank arrives and talks happily about how much he enjoyed the party, especially the wine. He leaves and Torvald discovers two visiting cards that Dr. Rank put in his letterbox, indicating that he is about to die. Nora says goodnight to Torvald and sneaks out to the hall, preparing to escape and commit suicide. However Torvald stops her, having discovered the letter from Krogstad. He is furious with her, saying she has ruined his life and that, although they will keep living together to preserve appearances, they cannot be happy and he won\u2019t let her raise their children.\nThe maid brings a note from Krogstad saying he no longer wishes to blackmail Nora; the IOU is enclosed. Torvald rejoices, saying he is saved and that he forgives Nora. However, Nora reveals that she was going to kill her herself because she thought that Torvald would step forward and defend her, ruining his life and career. She explains that she has realized that she can no longer live with Torvald, whom she considers to be a stranger to her, and wishes to leave in order to discover a sense of who she is. Torvald at first calls her stupid and insane, before changing his tone and promising to change so that she will stay. Nora, resolute, says she must leave. Torvald is left alone onstage in despair. The play ends with the sound of the slam of the front door as Nora exits.\n \tCHARACTERS\nMAJOR CHARACTERS\nNora Helmer \u2013 Nora Helmer is the heroine of the play. Still a young woman, she is married to Torvald Helmer and has three children. At the play\u2019s outset, she is bubbly and carefree, excited about Christmas and her husband\u2019s recent promotion. Although she is frustrated by the fact that the other characters believe she is a \u201cspendthrift,\u201d she does not seem to really mind, and happily plays along with Torvald\u2019s pet names for her, which include \u201cskylark,\u201d \u201csongbird,\u201d \u201csquirrel,\u201d and \u201cpet.\u201d Torvald also regularly refers to her and treats her as a child, for example, by forbidding her from eating macaroons, something she does anyway despite her promises of total obedience to him. The animal and child imagery both reflect Nora\u2019s apparently innocent, carefree nature, and suggest that her husband does not think of her as a proper adult because she is a woman. As the play progresses, it is revealed that Nora\u2019s disobedience consists of more than simply eating the occasional macaroon: at the beginning of her marriage, she secretly borrowed money from Nils Krogstad and forged her father\u2019s signature in order to finance a trip to Italy that was necessary to save Torvald\u2019s life. When Torvald finds out about the debt and fails to forgive her until he is sure that his reputation is safe, Nora realizes that her understanding of herself, her husband, her marriage, and even her society was all wrong. She decides that she can no longer be happy in her life and marriage, and resolves to leave Torvald and her home in order to find a sense of self and learn about the world. The play's final image of Nora is of an embittered yet sophisticated, intelligent, and newly empowered woman boldly escaping the infantilizing clutches of her old life.\nTorvald Helmer \u2013 Torvald Helmer is a lawyer who at the play\u2019s outset has recently been promoted to Bank Manager. He is married to Nora Helmer, with whom he has three children. He does not seem particularly fond of his children, even once saying that their presence makes the house \u201cunbearable to anyone except mothers.\u201d Straightforward and traditional in his beliefs about marriage and society, he loves and is very affectionate towards Nora, but often treats her more as a pet, child, or object than as a real person. His best friend is Dr. Rank, who visits him every day. However, towards the end of the play this friendship is revealed to be something of a fa\u00e7ade, as Torvald seems untroubled and even a little relieved at the thought of Dr. Rank\u2019s death. A similar occurrence happens when he finds out about Nora\u2019s secret debt and instantly turns on her until he realizes that his reputation is safe. Torvald's focus on status and being treated as superior by people like Nils Krogstad, highlights his obsession with reputation and appearances. When Nora tells him she is leaving him, Torvald at first reacts by calling her mad and saying she is acting like a stupid child. However, when he realizes how resolute she is in her decision, Torvald offers to change and desperately searches for a way to stay with her. His despair as Nora exits at the very end of the play suggests that, despite his patronizing and unjust treatment of her, Torvald really does love Nora (or at least the idea of her).\nKristine Linde \u2013 Mrs. Linde, as she is generally",

His despair as Nora exits at the very end of the play suggests that, despite his patronizing and unjust treatment of her, Torvald really does love Nora (or at least the idea of her).\nKristine Linde \u2013 Mrs. Linde, as she is generally known to the other characters, is an old friend of Nora's. She is a woman whose marriage was loveless, and based on a need for financial security, and who doesn\u2019t have any children. She and Krogstad had been in love at the time, but he was too poor to support her family. She arrives in town in search of a job in order to earn money and survive independently. In this way, she is a fairly modern woman; towards the end of the play, she explains to Krogstad that she finds joy and meaning in work. However, in other ways she is more traditional. She tells both Krogstad and Nora that she is miserable without other people to take care of, thereby fitting into the traditional role of women as caretakers and nurturers. It is this conviction that causes her to marry Krogstad towards the end of the play. She believes very deeply in honesty and stops Krogstad from taking the letter he wrote to Torvald back, thereby ensuring that Torvald find out about Nora\u2019s secret. Although this at first seems like a betrayal of Nora, it turns out to ultimately be a decision to Nora\u2019s benefit as it is after Torvald finds out about the debt that Nora is able to see the true nature of her marriage. This twist confirms Mrs. Linde\u2019s belief that honesty is always better than deceit, even if Mrs. Linde's expectation was that it was Nora's deceit that needed to be exposed, not the shallowness of Torvald's feelings.\nNils Krogstad \u2013 Nils Krogstad is, at least at the beginning, the antagonist of the play. Known to the other characters as unscrupulous and dishonest, he blackmails Nora, who borrowed money from him with a forged signature, after learning that he is being fired from his job at the bank. In the past, he too committed the crime of forgery, an act that he did not go to prison for but that nonetheless ruined his reputation and made it extremely difficult to find a respectable job. Later in the play it is revealed that he was once in love with Kristine Linde, who ended up marrying another man in order to have enough money to support her dying mother and young brothers. This left Krogstad lost and embittered, unhappy in his own marriage, and is presented as the reason behind his moral corruption. At first he treats Nora without mercy on the basis that no mercy has been shown to him in life; however, after he and Mrs. Linde decide to marry, he becomes happier and rescinds his threats to Nora, saying he regrets his behavior. He is one of several examples in the play of a person being forced into morally questionable action as a result of the rigid and unmerciful forces of society.\nDr. Rank \u2013 Dr. Rank is a doctor who is best friends with Torvald and Nora, who he visits every day. Dr. Rank suffers from spinal tuberculosis, a condition he believes was caused by his father\u2019s vices, which included having extramarital affairs and consuming too much luxurious food and drink. Dr. Rank is unmarried and lonely, and over the course of the play it is revealed that he is in love with Nora. Cynical about life, he rejoices when he finds out that his illness is terminal, and insists that neither Torvald nor Nora visit him in his dying days. As he predicted, he is not particularly missed by the other characters.\nThe nursemaid \u2013 Nurse to both Nora and Nora's children, the nursemaid, whose name is Anne Marie, is a kind woman who was forced to give up her own child, who it is suggested was born out of wedlock. The nursemaid is an example of a woman in bad circumstances forced to do anything in order to survive. When Nora first thinks of leaving she considers the fact that her children will be raised by the nursemaid and, remembering what a good mother the nursemaid had been to her, decides that she would also raise Nora\u2019s children well.\nMINOR CHARACTERS\nThe maid \u2013 The maid, whose name is Helene, is a servant in the Helmers\u2019 household.\nThe porter \u2013 The porter delivers the Helmers\u2019 Christmas tree.\nThe children \u2013 Nora and Torvald have three children, whose names are Ivar, Bobby, and Emmy. Still fairly young, they delight in playing with their mother. Although they are referred to by the others very frequently, they are only once seen on stage.\n \tTHEMES\nIn LitCharts literature guides, each theme gets its own colorcoded icon. These icons make it easy to track where the themes occur most prominently throughout the work. If you don't have a color printer, you can still use the icons to track themes in black and white.\nLOVE AND MARRIAGE\nAs a play focused around the marriage between Nora and Torvald, A Doll's House can be seen as an exploration of love and marriage, or even, more\nprofoundly, on whether there can be love in marriage. At the beginning of the play, Nora and Torvald appear to be very happily married, even to themselves. Nora talks joyfully about her love for Torvald, and Torvald refers to Nora using affectionate pet names. Their loving marriage stands in stark contrast with the lives of the other characters: the marriages of Krogstad and Mrs. Linde were based on necessity rather than love, and were unhappy. While Dr. Rank was never married, and, it is revealed, has silently loved Nora for years. Yet although Nora and Torvald\u2019s marriage is based on love (as opposed to necessity, as was the case with Krogstad and Mrs. Linde), it is nonetheless still governed by the strict rules of society that dictated the roles of husband and wife. It is clear that Nora is expected to obey Torvald and allow him to make decisions for her; meanwhile, it is important for Torvald\u2019s career that he is able to show off a successful marriage to a dutiful woman.\nAt first it seems that Nora and Torvald both enjoy playing the roles of husband and wife in a way that is considered respectable by society. However, Nora soon reveals to Mrs. Linde that she went behind Torvald\u2019s back by borrowing the money from Krogstad, and therefore has already broken both the law and the rules of marriage at the time. This creates a dilemma: Nora broke the rules of marriage, yet did so in order to save her husband\u2019s life\u2014a true act of love. Yet this is an act of love that society condemns, thereby placing the rules of marriage above love. In the final moments of the play, it's revealed that Nora's fear of the secret getting out is not a fear that she will end up shamed and punished, but rather is based on her certainty that Torvald will protect her by taking the blame, and in so doing will ruin himself.\nNora is certain that beneath the role Torvald is playing, that he loves her just as deeply as she loved him when she secretly broke the rules of society. Of course, Torvald's reaction reveals that he's not in fact \"playing a role\" at all\u2014he really does put his reputation first, and he would never sacrifice it to protect Nora. What Nora thought was role-playing was in fact the entire reality. This cements Nora\u2019s disillusionment with her marriage, and with marriage in general\u2014she comes to the conclusion that not only does Torvald not love her, but that the institution of marriage, as it is conceived and practiced in her society, may make love impossible. While Krogstad and Mrs. Linde's joyous choice to marry may suggest that the play does not entirely share Nora's view, it is important to note that their marriage does not at all conform to the norms of society. Mrs. Linde yearns for the purpose she would get by truly caring form someone she loves, while Krogstad sees Mrs. Linde not as some ornament to augment his reputation but as the source of the salvation of his integrity.\nGENDER\nA Doll\u2019s House exposes the restricted role of women during the time of its writing and the problems that arise from a drastic imbalance of power between\nmen and women. Throughout the play, Nora is treated like a child by the other characters. Torvald calls her his \u201cpet\u201d and his \u201cproperty,\u201d and implies that she is not smart or responsible enough to be trusted with money. Neither Krogstad nor Dr. Rank take her seriously, and even Mrs. Linde calls her a \u201cchild.\u201d While this treatment does seem to mildly frustrate Nora, she plays along with it, calling herself \u201clittle Nora\u201d and promising that she would never dream of disobeying her husband. However, there are clues that she is not entirely happy with the limited position she has as a woman. When revealing the secret of how she borrowed money to finance the trip to Italy, she refers to it as her \u201cpride\u201d and says it was fun to be in control of money, explaining that it was \u201calmost like being a man.\u201d Although she comes to regret her decision to borrow money, Nora\u2019s dissatisfaction with her status as a woman intensifies over the course of the play. In the final scene she tells Torvald that she is not being treated as an independent person with a mind of her own. Her radical solution to this issue is to leave domestic life behind, despite Torvald's declaration that he will change. Nora's decision suggests that she, and the play, see the issue as only partially with Torvald. The more fundamental issue is with domestic life as it was conceived and lived at the time, in the way it legally and culturally infantilized women and made it impossible for them to be recognized or treated as full individuals.\nMeanwhile, the men of the play are also expected to fill a certain role. Both Torvald and Krogstad are very ambitious, driven not only by the need to provide for their families but also by a desire to achieve higher status. Respectability is of great concern to both of them; when Nora\u2019s borrowing is revealed, Torvald\u2019s first thoughts are for his reputation. Meanwhile, Krogstad is fixated on achieving success now that he has \u201cgone straight,\u201d and intends to one day take over Torvald\u2019s job and run the bank.\nMONEY AND WORK\nA need for money affects all the major characters in A Doll\u2019s House. In the beginning of the play it is revealed that Torvald was recently promoted and\nwill receive \u201ca big fat income,\u201d however he still chastises Nora for spending too much, arguing that they need to be cautious financially. Mrs. Linde is in desperate need of a job following the death of her husband, and after her replacement of Krogstad at the bank leaves him threatening to turn Nora in in order to get his job back. Indeed, the bank works as a symbol for the pervasive presence of money in the characters\u2019 lives.\nIn the play, money symbolizes the power that the characters have over one another. In the first scene, Torvald\u2019s ability to dictate how much Nora spends on Christmas presents shows his power over her. Meanwhile, the debt that Nora owes Krogstad allows him to have power over her and Torvald. Both Nora and Mrs. Linde cannot earn large incomes because they are women; their inability to access significant amounts of money is one way that they are oppressed by the sexism of the time. The play also shows that, while earning money leads to power, it can also be dangerous. In the beginning of the play, Nora is proud of the fact that she \u201craised\u201d the money for her and Torvald\u2019s trip to Italy herself\u2014however the debt she owes soon becomes a source of terror, dread, and shame. The thrill of obtaining money is therefore shown to have a downside.\nDECEIT\nAt the beginning of the play, Nora appears to be a dutifully obedient and honest wife, however it is\nquickly revealed that she is hiding a serious secret\nfrom him\u2014the fact that she borrowed money from Krogstad to finance a trip to Italy that she claims saved Torvald\u2019s life. This renders all her statements about never disobeying him or hiding anything from him deceitful. When she reveals her dishonesty to Mrs. Linde, Mrs. Linde insists that she ought to confess to Torvald immediately, insisting that a marriage cannot succeed when husband and wife are not completely honest with each other.\nA parallel occurs between Nora and Krogstad when it is revealed that they both committed forgery. Their acts of deception spark the unravelling of both their lives\u2014Krogstad\u2019s reputation is ruined, and Nora is forced to re-evaluate everything about herself and the society around her, eventually leading her decision to leave her husband and family at the end of the play. In some ways, deceit is presented as a corrupting and corroding force in the people\u2019s lives; however, in Nora\u2019s case, it is clear that the motivation for her dishonesty was love\u2014she lied in order to save her husband\u2019s life. Furthermore, her actions wouldn't have had to be deceitful if it weren\u2019t for societal law dictating that women were not allowed to handle financial matters independently. Therefore Nora\u2019s deceit was not the result of a personal flaw, but rather the only means necessary of overcoming restrictions in order to commit a noble act.\nINDIVIDUAL VS.

SOCIETY\nNora, a dutiful mother and wife, spends most of the play putting others before herself. She thinks little of how her act of forgery and debt to Krogstad\naffect her personally, opting instead to worry about how they might impact the lives of her husband and children. Even when she plans to kill herself near the end of the play, it is not to hide her shame but rather because she thinks that if she is alive then Torvald will ruin himself in trying to protect her. In a similar vein, Mrs. Linde admits that, without a husband or any family members to care for, she feels that her life is pointless. Therefore both women find a sense of meaning in their lives through serving others and performing the caring, obedient role that society requires of them. During the play, however, Nora learns that prioritizing her duty as a wife and mother cannot lead to real happiness. She realizes, when it becomes clear that Torvald would never have sacrificed his reputation to protect her, that while she thought she was sacrificing herself to protect her love, in fact no such love existed, and indeed the structure of society makes the love she had imagined to be real an impossibility. She therefore decides to leave him in order to develop a sense of her own identity. The play ends with Nora choosing to put herself as an individual before society\u2019s expectations of her.\nThroughout most of the play it seems that Krogstad cares more about his reputation than anything else. Punished by society for his act of forgery, he is desperate to reclaim respectability in the eyes of others. However, his conversation with Mrs. Linde in the third act shows him that he will only achieve happiness through truly reforming himself and regaining the personal integrity that he lost rather than the outward respectability. In a similar way to Nora, Krogstad learns that society\u2019s view of him is meaningless if he doesn\u2019t respect himself as an individual.\n \tSYMBOLS\nSymbols appear in teal text throughout the Summary and Analysis sections of this LitChart.\nTHE CHRISTMAS TREE\nThe Christmas tree is delivered in Nora\u2019s flurry of excitement for Christmas. It symbolizes family\nhappiness and unity, as well as the joy Nora takes in making her home pleasant and attractive. At the beginning of Act Two, the tree has been stripped and the candles burned out; the stage directions dictate that it should look \u201cbedraggled.\u201d This represents the end of Nora\u2019s innocence and foreshadows the Helmer family\u2019s eventual disintegration.\nMACAROONS\nTorvald has banned Nora from eating macaroons.\nAlthough Nora claims that she never disobeys Torvald, this is proved false in the very opening of the play when Nora eats macaroons while she was alone in the living room. The macaroons come to represent Nora\u2019s disobedience and deceit. She lies to Dr. Rank about having been given some by Mrs. Linde, and after giving a particularly tempestuous performance of the tarantella asks that macaroons be served at dinner, indicating a relationship between the macaroons and Nora\u2019s inner passions, both of which she must hide within her marriage.\nTHE TARANTELLA\nLike the macaroons, the tarantella symbolizes a side of Nora that she cannot normally show. It is a\nfiery, passionate dance that allows Nora to drop the fa\u00e7ade of the perfect mild-mannered Victorian wife. Throughout the play, Nora uses performance to please Torvald, and the tarantella is no exception; he admits that watching her perform it makes her desire her. However, this is only under very controlled circumstances, and Torvald seems to enjoy the fact that it is a performance that impresses other people more than anything.\nTHE DOLL\u2019S HOUSE\nThere are a few mentions of doll\u2019s houses early on in the play, for example when Nora shows Torvald\nthe dolls she bought for her daughter, and says that the fact that they are cheap doesn\u2019t matter because she will probably break them soon anyway. This is interesting as it suggests that Nora is raising her daughter for a life similar to Nora\u2019s own, yet simultaneously foreshadows Nora breaking up her family life by leaving Torvald. When Nora plays with her children she also refers to them as her \u201clittle dollies.\u201d However, it is not until the end of the play that the metaphor becomes explicitly clear. Nora tells Torvald that both he and her father treated her like a doll, and cites this as one of the reasons why she has become dissatisfied and disillusioned with her life with him.\n \tQUOTES\nNote: all page numbers for the quotes below refer to the Oxford University Press edition of Four Major Playspublished in 1998.\nAct One Quotes\nNora! Just like a woman. Seriously though, Nora, you know what I think about these things. No debts! Never borrow! There\u2019s always something inhibited, something unpleasant, about a home built on credit and borrowed money.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker), Nora Helmer\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 3\nExplanation and Analysis\nAlthough Torvald has just recently received a promotion that means he will earn a larger salary, here he chastises Nora for spending too much on Christmas presents, particularly considering he won't be paid for a few more months. Torvald and Nora's differing opinions reveal their contrasting attitudes toward the issue of money and debt. While Torvald is cautious about overspending and sees borrowing as irresponsible and even immoral, as something that destroys one's self-sufficiency, Nora believes there is nothing wrong with spending and borrowing now that\nTorvald's job gives them financial security. Further, by saying that Nora is acting \"just like a woman,\" Torvald shows that he considers women irrational and untrustworthy when it comes to money (and in general).\nThe irony of Torvald's condemnation of borrowing is that Nora has alreadyborrowed money; though Torvald doesn't know it, his own home is \"built on credit.\" This shows that Torvald has less control over his wife than he believes. It also suggests that there is not necessarily always something \"unpleasant\" about a home built on debt, as Torvald does not consider his own home unpleasant. At the same time, this statement seems to foreshadow the unpleasantness and eventual disintegration of Torvald and Nora's home later in the play.\n \npromotion and raise. This indicates that Torvald takes pleasure in the power that comes with having a high-paying job, perhaps more than he cares about having money to spend. His statement highlights the importance of income and status within the world of the play.\nThis passage also once again reveals Torvald's na\u00efvet\u00e9, as later in the play his \"safe\" job will be threatened. It also will later expose his cruelty; despite the importance he himself places on having a secure position, he is merciless when it comes to firing Krogstad.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Torvald Helmer\nRelated Themes:\nRelated Symbols:\nPage Number: 5\nExplanation and Analysis\nHere Nora plays the part of the perfect wife, promising absolute obedience to Torvald\u2014in this case specifically related to the fact that he has forbidden her to eat macaroons. On one level this quote seems to convey Nora's love for her husband and her acceptance of gender roles, suggesting she adores Torvald so much that she is willing to give up her own agency in order to make him happy. However, in reality she is lying. She has already disobeyed him, both in the minor act of eating macaroons just a few minutes earlier, and in the major transgression of borrowing money much earlier in their marriage.\nNora has thus deceived Torvald on two levels: first by disobeying him, and then by lying about it. The exaggerated nature of the phrase \u2013 that she would \"never dream\" of disobeying him \u2013 adds further tension to the lie and suggests that the role Nora is trying to play is unrealistic and impossible, and therefore hints at her eventual refusal to play it.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 16\nExplanation and Analysis\nNora explains to Mrs. Linde that she has been secretly paying back the money she borrowed to fund the trip to Italy by avoiding spending money on herself and even taking on copying work, which she had to complete at night so that Torvald would not notice. This quote reveals a more selfless and mature side to Nora, who has previously been treated and behaved - like a vain and spoiled child. The fact that she has been prepared to sacrifice so much for Torvald shows that she really does love her husband, despite the fact that she deceives him.\nIbsen suggests that Nora's deception might be necessary because Torvald does not trust her to make sensible decisions on her own (and on a wider level, in this society men in general don't trust or respect women in general).Torvald believes Nora only wants to engage in frivolous pursuits, when in fact she shows here that she enjoys the responsibility of earning money to help her family. This passage contains the first hint that Nora might be dissatisfied with the traditional role she is expected to perform as a wife and mother. Indeed, it foreshadows the decision she makes at the end of the play to sacrifice her comfortable lifestyle in order to become autonomous and independent.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 6\nExplanation and Analysis\nHaving just scolded Nora for spending too much, Torvald now decides to give her extra money anyway and then reflects on how pleased he is to have been given a\n  Oh, sometimes I was so tired, so tired. But it was tremendous fun all the same, sitting there working and earning money like that. Almost like being a man.\nOh, what a glorious feeling it is, knowing you\u2019ve got a nice, safe job, and a good fat income.\n \n  Oh, I think I can say that some of us have a little influence now and again. Just because one happens to be a woman,\ndoesn\u2019t mean\u2026 People in subordinate positions, ought to take care they don\u2019t offend anybody\u2026 who\u2026 hm\u2026\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 24\nExplanation and Analysis\nHaving told Krogstad that Mrs Linde is to have a position at the bank, Nora shows off by implying that it is thanks to her that Mrs Linde was given the job. Again, Nora wishes to prove that she is an autonomous and influential person in spite of her gender, and seems to want to be more involved with the world of work. On the other hand, she probably thinks it is safe to express these feelings to Krogstad, who does not have high social status. It is unlikely she would make the same statement if Torvald were in the room.\nThe fact that Nora's mention of \"people in subordinate positions\" follows her claim about being a woman suggests she is talking about her own subordination due to her gender. However, it then becomes clear that she is referring to Krogstad's subordinate role at the bank. This connection highlights the parallel situation of Nora and Krogstad: their attempts to act freely are thwarted by the power that Torvald has over them. It also shows that Nora enjoys feeling superior to Krogstad, rather than empathizing with him due to their shared lower social status.\n  I am not so heartless that I would necessarily want to condemn a man for a single mistake like that.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker), Nils Krogstad\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 32\nExplanation and Analysis\nTorvald explains to Nora that Krogstad committed forgery, and when she suggests that he might have done so out of necessity, Torvald replies that Krogstad was probably just careless - but that even so, Torvald would have forgiven him for that mistake alone. Here Torvald presents himself as a fair and reasonable source of moral authority with the individual power to bestow forgiveness on others. This\nquote also confirms that Torvald despises deceit above anything else; although forgery is illegal, it is Krogstad's dishonesty that Torvald finds inexcusable.\nTorvald and Nora are discussing Krogstad here, but Torvald's words also carry implications for how he might react to discovering Nora's \"crimes\"; after all, Nora is guilty not only of forgery and deception, but also of borrowing money, an act Torvald vehemently condemns. However, as this could be seen as only \"one mistake,\" Ibsen leads us to expect that Torvald might forgive Nora. But at the play's climax, Torvald does not behave in the way he describes in this statement; instead he shows Nora no mercy, behaving in a manner that is truly heartless.\n  Just think how a man with a thing like that on his conscience will always be having to lie and cheat and\ndissemble; he can never drop the mask, not even with his own wife and children.

Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker), Nils Krogstad, Nora Helmer\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 33\nExplanation and Analysis\nTorvald describes the consequences of Krogstad's deception, insisting that it will have devastating consequences on his household. Torvald's melodramatic language highlights the fierce contempt he feels for\nKrogstad, and emphasizes that Torvald sees dishonesty as a kind of poison that corrupts the purity of domestic life. Again, this passage has a double meaning; just like Krogstad, Nora has also committed a crime and must keep it a secret from her family. Once more, Torvald unwittingly reveals his own ignorance, as he does not think there is a \"fog of lies\" in his own household or that his children are breathing \"evil germs.\"\nAt the same time, Torvald's comment that Krogstad \"can never drop the mask\" rings true for Nora. Ibsen has already shown that Nora pretends to be obedient, while in reality she disobeys and lies to Torvald. The pressure of this double life comes to take a major toll on Nora as the play progresses. However, Ibsen suggests that, deception aside, the pressure to perform the role of the perfect wife is itself\na kind of \"mask,\" as Torvald has unrealistic expectations of Nora and does not allow her to act freely as an individual. The \"mask\" in this passage thus connects to the symbol of the doll's house, foreshadowing Nora's claim at the end of the play that Torvald has treated her like a doll.\nAct Two Quotes\nWhen a poor girl\u2019s been in trouble she must make the best of things.\nRelated Characters: The nursemaid (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 36\nExplanation and Analysis\nNora has asked the nursemaid how she could bear to give up her child, and the nursemaid responds by explaining that it was out of necessity, as the child's father would not support her. This quote highlights how little freedom and power women had at the time; without a man to depend on, the nursemaid would have been unable to raise the child herself.\nThe nursemaid's predicament connects to Mrs. Linde's revelation that she married a man she didn't love due to financial need, as well as Nora's decision to forge her father's signature in order to secure the loan. Each woman was forced to act in a way they otherwise have never chosen due to the restrictive legal, economic, and social position of women in their society. Significantly, all three women choose to act in a way that is both selfless and pragmatic; Ibsen thus exposes the inaccuracy of the belief that women are foolish and incapable of making rational decisions.\n  You see Torvald is so terribly in love with me that he says he wants me all to himself. When we first married, it even\nused to make him sort of jealous if I only as much as mentioned any of my old friends back home. So of course I stopped doing it.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Torvald Helmer\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 38\nExplanation and Analysis\nMrs. Linde has expressed confusion at the fact that Torvald did not know who she was, and Nora responds by explaining that Torvald would become jealous if she ever mentioned her old friends, leading Nora to cease mentioning them at all. Though Nora justifies this by claiming it is because Torvald loves her, the phrase \"wants me all to himself\" suggests that Torvald views her as a possession - again foreshadowing Nora's later claim that he treats her like a doll. At this point Nora seems to genuinely believe that there is nothing wrong with Torvald's possessive behavior, and she sees it as natural that she should stop mentioning her old friends around him. This quote reveals her strong desire to conform to gender roles and be a perfect wife, even if it comes at the expense of her own happiness.\n  A man\u2019s better at coping with these things than a woman\u2026\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 39\nExplanation and Analysis\nNora, desperate to find a solution to the fact that Krogstad is blackmailing her, considers asking Dr. Rank for help, on the basis that he has money and is a man. On one level, her\nreasoning for going to Dr. Rank is valid; he is in a considerably more powerful position than Nora, with financial means and legal rights that she does not have. On the other hand, this quote suggests that she has internalized the sexist idea that women are unsuited to handle serious matters. Despite the hard work and skillful negotiation she exhibited in borrowing and paying back the money in the first place, Nora is still convinced that she needs a man's help in order to find a solution to her current predicament.\n  If it ever got around that the new manager had been talked over by his wife\u2026 As long as the little woman gets her own\nstubborn way\u2026!

This passage shows how cruel Torvald can be to Nora, and suggests he has little respect for her. The phrase \"little woman\" again brings to mind the symbol of the doll's house and Torvald's treatment of Nora as a doll.\nAt the same time, Torvald's words also reveal that he as an individual is not entirely to blame for his sexist attitude. His dismissal of Nora seems motivated by a fear that, if he were to take her opinion seriously, he would be ridiculed by other men at the bank and that his career could even suffer as a result. Here Ibsen emphasizes the pressure on all the characters in the play to maintain appearances and conform to the norms of society.\n  Now Dr. Rank, cheer up. You\u2019ll see tomorrow how nicely I can dance. And you can pretend I\u2019m doing it just for you\u2014and for Torvald as well, of course.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Dr. Rank, Torvald Helmer Related Themes:\nRelated Symbols:\nPage Number: 47\nExplanation and Analysis\nDr. Rank has told Nora that he is dying and that she and Torvald will soon forget him, but Nora brushes him off and attempts to distract him by mentioning the Tarantella. Her behavior in this passage is rather childlike, as she is dismissive of Dr. Rank's melancholic feelings and seems unwilling to discuss the sober matter of his death. Her flirtatious behavior would similarly have been seen as immature and irresponsible, far from the ideal of a modest married woman.\nThis passage also serves as another example of Nora's use\nof the Tarantella to appease men; she often brings it up to distract from conflict with Torvald, and here she uses a similar strategy with Dr. Rank. Her suggestion that Dr. Rank imagines she is dancing \"just for him\" highlights the pervasive notion that men wanted exclusive ownership of women.\n  I want to get on my feet again, Mrs. Helmer; I want to get to the top\u2026 For the last eighteen months I\u2019ve gone\nstraight; all that time it\u2019s been hard going; I was content to work my way up, step by step.

Although money is highly important in the play, Krogstad's speech confirms that the opinion of society is even more valuable than wealth. At the same time, it also highlights the limitations of behaving according to society's rules. Krogstad has been honest and worked \"step by step,\" only to find himself fired; in order to regain dignity, he feels compelled to return to tactics of scheming and deceit.\n  You can\u2019t frighten me!

Torvald's statement conveys that Nora's inner turmoil has reached a level of crisis. She can no longer play the part of the carefree, childlike doll-wife, and has even considered committing suicide. Indeed, following this statement Nora replies that her life doesdepend on the dance; this prefigures her later statement to Torvald that she performed for him - \"doing tricks\" - in order to survive.\nAt the same time, Nora's wild dancing style can also be seen as representative of her longing to break away from the strict codes of behavior for Victorian women. The fact that she ignores Torvald's instructions as she dances foreshadows her eventual decision to leave her husband and children in order to pursue a life of freedom.\ntake her seriously. Krogstad's attitude here echoes the way that Torvald belittles Nora; by calling her a \"little... thing,\" Krogstad, too, treats Nora like a doll, implying she does not have any agency or power. At the same time, Krogstad's use of the word \"pampered\" reflects Mrs. Linde and the nursemaid's (more gentle) allusions to the fact that Nora has been spared the harsh realities of life on account of her husband's wealth. In other words, the rest of the characters do not think Nora is capable of making choices for herself both because she is a woman and thus has not been allowed to, and because she is rich and has thus not been forcedto. Of course, this underestimation turns out to be mistaken, as revealed by Nora's drastic actions in the Third Act of the play.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Torvald Helmer\nRelated Themes:\nRelated Symbols:\nPage Number: 58\nExplanation and Analysis\nTorvald has come perilously close to opening the letterbox and finding Krogstad's letter, and in order to distract him Nora pretends to be nervous about the Tarantella, insisting that she needs to rehearse and that she requires Torvald's help. On one level, this behavior is purely manipulative, as Nora knows the Tarantella is guaranteed to catch Torvald's attention. Her claim to need his help can similarly be seen as a way of appeasing him by playing the role of the obedient, submissive wife.\nAt the same time, Nora does still love Torvald, and this quote can also be interpreted as a genuine desire on her part for Torvald to take care of her. As Nora grows increasingly frantic about Krogstad's threat, she remains unable to seek guidance from her husband, and thus is left isolated and in turmoil. This quote thus also serves as a reminder that Nora and Torvald's marriage isn't all bad, and that Nora truly does crave and appreciate the support of her husband.\nRelated Characters: Nils Krogstad (speaker), Kristine Linde\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 63\nExplanation and Analysis\nMrs. Linde has invited Krogstad to speak with her at the Helmers' house while they are out, but Krogstad seems reluctant, saying that they have nothing to say to each other. At this moment it is revealed that Mrs. Linde and Krogstad once planned to marry, but that Mrs. Linde ended up marrying another man.

Nils, give me somebody and something to work for.\nRelated Characters: Kristine Linde (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 64\nExplanation and Analysis\nMrs. Linde has suggested that she and Krogstad marry, and tries to convince Krogstad by explaining that her life feels meaningless without anyone to work for and take care of. Here Mrs. Linde embodies a traditional idea of womanhood, which poses that women mostly find meaning in life through selfless acts and caring for others. Unlike Nora, who feels ambivalent about a life totally dedicated to her husband and children, Mrs. Linde is fully committed to this path. This is evidenced not only in her speech to Krogstad but also in her original choice to marry a wealthier man in order to financially provide for her mother and brothers, as well as her continued support for Nora throughout the play.\nBy including Nora and Mrs. Linde's differing attitudes toward this model of selfless womanhood, Ibsen shows that women do not have one single relationship to femininity and traditional values. The message of the play is not that all women should live independent, individualistic lives as Nora\neventually decides to, but rather that women should be able to choose based on their own preferences.\n  Helmer must know everything.

This shift in stakes emphasizes the theme that deception is unsustainable and that it will inevitably lead to disaster. Also Mrs. Linde, having previously behaved as a rather passive source of support for Nora, now enacts a pivotal moment of agency, greatly affecting the fates of the other characters. This scene could also be interpreted as a moment in which Mrs. Linde forsakes her allegiance to Nora specifically and instead allies herself with the institution of marriage, and the principle of honesty between husband and wife.\n  His suffering and his loneliness seemed almost to provide a background of dark cloud to the sunshine of our lives.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker), Dr. Rank\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 74\nExplanation and Analysis\nHaving learned from Nora that Dr. Rank is about to die and thus that they will never see him again, Torvald does not feel pity for his friend, but only regretful that Dr. Rank will not be around to make his and Nora's life seem even happier. The fact that Torvald responds this way to the death of his best friend highlights his cold-heartedness, foreshadowing his cruel reaction to the revelation of Nora's secret. At this point the antagonist of the play is no longer Krogstad, who has been redeemed by the promise of his marriage to Mrs.\nLinde, but rather Torvald.\nThis quote also makes clear how much Torvald's idea of a happy and meaningful life is dependent on outside appearances. He appreciated Dr. Rank's presence because of how much happier he made Tora and Norvald seem,not because of the the actual pleasure of his company. Again, this prefigures his insistence upon learning Nora's secret that they stay married and keep up appearances for society's sake, even though they will be miserable.\n  The thing must be hushed up at all costs. And as far as you and I are concerned, things must appear to go on exactly as\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker) Related Themes:  \nbefore. But only in the eyes of the world, of course\u2026 From now on, their can be no question of happiness. All we can do is save the bits and pieces from the wreck, preserve appearances\u2026\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker)\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 76\nExplanation and Analysis\nHaving discovered the letter from Krogstad exposing Nora's secret debt, Torvald flies into a rage, insulting Nora and her father. Immediately afterward, however, Torvald insists that they stay married and that everything must appear to go on as before. The fact that Torvald clearly despises Nora, admits that they will never be happy, and yet maintains that they must \"preserve appearances\" shows the extent to which he values societal approval above everything else.\nIn many ways, this is worse than any of the possible outcomes Ibsen has led the audience to anticipate. Torvald vows never to forgive Nora, insisting that their relationship is destroyed forever; at the same time, he traps her in their marriage, effectively forbidding her even from committing suicide or escaping to start a new life. This reaction demonstrates the absolute power Torvald wishes to have over Nora, and which he believes is his right as her husband.\n  I wouldn\u2019t be a proper man if I didn\u2019t find a woman doubly attractive for being so obviously helpless.\nPage Number: 78\nExplanation and Analysis\nUpon discovering the second letter from Krogstad in which he revokes his original threat of blackmail, Torvald immediately forgives Nora, rejoicing in the fact that his reputation is no longer in jeopardy. While this total reversal makes sense considering the fact that Torvald only truly cares about societal approval, it is important to note the shift in the way Torvald treats Nora before and after reading Krogstad's second letter.\nWhile Torvald still believes that Krogstad will blackmail him, he blames the entire situation on Nora, calling her a hypocrite, liar, criminal, and a \"miserable... feather-brained woman.\" However, as soon as he knows his reputation is safe, Torvald shows mercy toward Nora, calling her \"helpless\" and saying that she made an error without his guidance, but that she is not at fault. This stark contrast exposes the superficiality of Torvald's love for Nora, and emphasizes the extent to which he loves her only as long as she is remains in a passive, child-like role. His statement about loving her for her helplessness shows how normal it was in Victorian society for men to treat their wives like children.\n  For a man, there is something indescribably moving and very satisfying in knowing that he has forgiven his\nwife\u2014forgiven her, completely and genuinely, from the depths of his heart. It\u2019s as though it made her his property in a double sense: he has, as it were, given her a new life, and she becomes in a way both his wife and at the same time his child.\nRelated Characters: Torvald Helmer (speaker), Nora Helmer\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 78\nExplanation and Analysis\nNora has tried to leave the room, but Torvald stops her, continuing to speak joyously about how wonderful it is that he has forgiven her. The speech takes a perverse turn when he explains that Nora is now \"his property in a double sense,\" because by forgiving her he has given her a new life. Torvald's use of this metaphor takes patriarchal logic to the extreme, suggesting that Torvald sees himself in a god-like role.\nEven more disturbingly, Torvald then remarks that this double-ownership means that Nora is simultaneously his wife and also his child. Even if we put aside the paedophilic overtones of this statement, it is clear that Torvald never wished his relationship with Nora to be equal and mutually respectful. Indeed, his joy seems to stem from the fact that due to his discovery of her secret debt - he believes he will henceforth always enjoy an unquestioned moral superiority and authority over his wife. While Torvald expresses a desire to control Nora throughout the play, it is only at this moment that he fully voices his alarmingly infantilizing feelings about her.\n  I have been your doll wife, just as at home I was Daddy\u2019s doll child. And the children in turn have been my dolls. I\nthought it was fun when you came and played with me, just as they thought it was fun when I went to play with them. That\u2019s been our marriage, Torvald.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Torvald Helmer\nRelated Themes:\nRelated Symbols:\nPage Number: 80\nExplanation and Analysis\nNora accuses both Torvald and her father of treating her like a doll, and compares her life to a doll's house. At this point the full meaning of the play's title becomes clear. Nora acknowledges that she has found pleasure in her doll life, enjoying the moments when Torvald chooses to \"play\" with her and when she chooses to play with the children. Ibsen has shown evidence of this, particularly at the beginning of the play when Nora delighted in performing for Torvald and playing the role of the perfect, obedient wife.\nHowever, at this moment it is clear that Nora has undergone a transformation, leading her to view her life from a different, much more critical perspective.\nIntriguingly, although Torvald has behaved in a cruel and disdainful way toward her, Nora does not cite this behaviour as the main problem with their marriage. Rather, she implies that their interactions are doomed to be superficial and meaningless because of the fact that Torvald does not see\nher as an autonomous person, but rather as a possession which he can control. Nora appears to have realized that Torvald values her only because of the control he has over her and because of how their marriage appears to society.\n  I believe that first and foremost I am an individual, just as much as you are\u2014or at least I\u2019m going to try to be. I know\nmost people agree with you, Torvald, and that\u2019s also what it says in books. But I\u2019m not content anymore with what most people say, or what it says in books. I have to think things for myself, and get things clear.\nRelated Characters: Nora Helmer (speaker), Torvald Helmer\nRelated Themes:  \nPage Number: 82\nExplanation and Analysis\nShocked by Nora's objections to their life together and by her decision to leave, Torvald has insisted that she stay, arguing that she is \"first and foremost a wife and mother.\" Nora rejects this by saying that she is an individual before she is anything else. (This statement would have been highly scandalous at the time.) Significantly, Nora does acknowledge that most people remain committed to societal norms about gender and the family (aside from Torvald, this is also particularly true of Mrs. Linde). The fact that Nora mentions this shows how central the approval of society remains within the play, even at the moment when Nora decides to radically subvert societal expectations.\nIt is important to note that Nora rejects three major sources of knowledge about how she should choose to conduct her life: the opinion of her husband, the opinion of society as a whole, and the knowledge to be found in books. The last of these is especially significant, because it emphasizes the fact that Nora believes that the truth about how she should live can only be found within herself. Furthermore, she thinks she will only be able to gain access to this truth through living independently and figuring it out on her own. Though a fairly common notion in today's world, this was a highly unusual position to take in the 19th century, especially for a woman. Nora's speech thus confirms the extent to which \"A Doll's House\" was ahead of its time, foreshadowing debates about gender and autonomy that would not emerge until many decades later.\n\n \nThe color-coded icons under each analysis entry make it easy to track where the themes occur most prominently throughout the work.

Nora Helmer enters though the front door, dressed in her outdoor clothes and carrying lots of parcels. She is humming happily to herself. A porter enters behind her and delivers a Christmas tree ; Nora tells the maid to hide it so it is a surprise for the children, and gives the porter a large tip.

She goes and listens at the door of her husband Torvald\u2019s study, noting to herself that he is in.\n \n\n\nThe Helmers\u2019 house is decorated tastefully, showing the importance of money and respectability. Nora\u2019s happiness as she returns with the Christmas shopping reveals that she enjoys both spending money and doing nice things for her husband and children. At the same time, it will soon become clear that eating the macaroons is a small act of deceit and disobedience, as Torvald forbids them.\n\n   \n \n\n \nTorvald Helmer calls from his study, asking if Nora has just returned home and calling her his \u201clittle sky-lark\u201d and \u201clittle squirrel.\u201d Nora beckons him to enter the living room, quickly hiding the macaroons. She has been shopping and asks to show Torvald what she has bought. Torvald gently scolds her for spending too much. Nora replies that now Torvald is earning a large salary they can afford to spend more at Christmas; however, Torvald argues that, because his first paycheck won\u2019t come for three months, they must still be careful with money.\n \nTorvald\u2019s nicknames for Nora suggest that he thinks of her almost as a child or a pet. This impression is emphasized when Nora hides the macaroons, like a mischievous child afraid of getting caught.\nTorvald\u2019s parent-like attitude is highlighted by the gently scolding way he talks to Nora about money, implying that he thinks she's not intelligent enough to be financially responsible.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora suggests they could borrow money and pay it back after Torvald receives his paycheck. Torvald replies that this is a typical way of thinking for a woman, and delivers an impassioned speech about the dangers of debt, urging Nora to \u201cnever borrow!\u201d\n \nThis introduces the theme of debt and shows Nora and Torvald\u2019s wildly different views on the subject. Torvald\u2019s command, \u201cnever borrow!\u201d is ironic because, as will be revealed, it's already too late.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora concedes: \u201cjust as you say, Torvald.\u201d Torvald, not wanting to see her sulk, gives her more money. She is thrilled and thanks him enthusiastically.\n \nTorvald\u2019s rewards Nora for her obedience; his control of the money gives him power in the marriage, though Nora's obedience also allows her to manipulate him. And, of course, she has already borrowed money once, early in their marriage. So her obedience is somewhat shallow, and seems more a role she is playing, happily, than something she truly believes in.\n \n\n         \n \nNora shows off the presents she has bought for the children (a doll for her daughter; a sword and a horse for the boys) and the maids, which she admits were cheap. She hides Torvald\u2019s present for later. Torvald asks what she got for herself and Nora admits that she didn\u2019t get anything. When Torvald asks what she wants she says she would simply like some money, so she can have longer to think about what she wants and buy herself something later on. Torvald calls her a \u201cspendthrift\u201d and claims that she is irresponsible with money, arguing that it is a trait inherited from her father.\n \nChristmas represents family, and Nora\u2019s happiness shows she enjoys performing the role of a wife and mother. Her choice of toys suggests she buys into traditional gender roles: the girl must be a nurturing wife and mother, and the boys strong and powerful. At the same time, Nora's request for money to buy something for herself suggests she does want the ability to make decisions for herself.\nTorvald not entrusting Nora with the money for her own present demonstrates the imbalance of power in their marriage.\n\n         \n \n\n \nTorvald says that Nora is looking guilty and asks several times if she went to the candy store. Nora lies and says she didn\u2019t, saying she would \u201cnever dream of doing\u201d anything Torvald did not want her to.\n \nEven though Torvald and Nora appear to be in love, Torvald does not trust her, and Nora\u2019s sworn obedience is a lie; she was eating macaroons earlier.\n \n\n\n \n\nTorvald and Nora look forward to the evening, while recalling earlier Christmases when they didn\u2019t have as much money and Nora had to make decorations herself. Torvald repeatedly expresses his happiness that those times are over now that he has a larger income.\n \n\nMoney is central to Torvald and Nora\u2019s happiness. Torvald\u2019s emphasis on their new prosperity suggests how important money is to him as well.\n\n   \n \n\n \nDr. Rank and an unnamed lady arrive. Torvald says he does not want to receive visitors, but it is too late as Dr. Rank is already in his study. Meanwhile, the lady is waiting to see Nora.\n \nThe guests are separated by gender, showing a gulf between the sexes.\n \n\n\n \n\nTorvald exits to meet Dr. Rank in his study, while the lady, wearing traveling clothes, is shown in to see Nora in the living room. The lady greets Nora, who at first doesn\u2019t recognize her. Soon, however, Nora realizes it is Mrs. Linde. Nora remarks that Mrs. Linde has changed a great deal in the eight years since they last saw each other and tells her how happy she has been in the time that has passed. Nora is surprised and impressed that Mrs. Linde traveled to town in wintertime. She helps Mrs. Linde get comfortable and says that now Mrs. Linde looks like her old self again, only paler and thinner. Mrs. Linde notes that she is also a lot older. Nora interrupts the conversation and scolds herself for \u201cchattering on\u201d and remarks with sympathy that Mrs. Linde is now a widow. Mrs. Linde confirms that her husband died three years ago.\n \nMrs. Linde has been visibly changed by her life experiences; meanwhile, Nora\u2019s questioning is childlike. Nora\u2019s happiness in the last eight years has left her remaining girlishly innocent and na\u00efve, whereas Mrs. Linde seems much older. Mrs. Linde\u2019s decision to travel alone was unusual for women at the time, and Nora\u2019s admiration of her \u201ccourage\u201d suggests a desire for independence. Mrs. Linde\u2019s status as a widow adds to the impression that she is much older than Nora.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora asks if Mrs. Linde\u2019s husband left her any money or children, and Mrs. Linde confirms that she was left nothing, and that their marriage was loveless. Nora asks in disbelief if that is possible, and Mrs. Linde explains that it \u201csometimes happens.\u201d Nora remarks how sad it is that Mrs. Linde is now completely alone, and tells Mrs. Linde about her own three children.\n \nThis conversation shows the two sides to marriage: on the one hand, Nora\u2019s marriage to Torvald seems to be full of love, happiness, and security. Yet Mrs. Linde\u2019s marriage was unhappy and has left her alone and struggling to survive. Nora\u2019s comment about her children is tactless, showing naivet\u00e9.\n \nNora asks to hear about Mrs. Linde\u2019s life, but before Mrs. Linde can say anything, Nora shares the news about Torvald\u2019s promotion to Bank Manager. She explains that Torvald\u2019s increased salary will allow them to live a better life. She tells Mrs. Linde how wonderful it is to have lots of money and not have to worry. Mrs. Linde replies that it must be nice to have enough money, to which Nora retorts, \u201cnot just enough, but pots and pots of money.\u201d\n \nIn this part of the play Nora is childishly impolite. Mrs. Linde is obviously in a bad situation following the death of her husband, yet instead of listening to her Nora begins to insensitively boast about her and Torvald\u2019s good fortune. Her speech also shows that she believes money leads to freedom and happiness.\n\n   \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde says she remembers Nora being a \u201cspendthrift\u201d in their school days, and Nora admits that Torvald still calls her that. However, she says that she is smarter than that, and explains that she couldn\u2019t have spent a lot as they haven\u2019t had much money, and that she and Torvald have both had to work. Mrs. Linde is surprised. Nora says she did \u201codd jobs\u201d such as sewing, embroidery, \u201cand one or two other things besides.\u201d She says that after they got married Torvald worked so hard that he became very sick, and that the doctors said he had to travel South in order to get better.\n \nTorvald\u2019s idea that Nora is irresponsible with money is here backed up by Mrs. Linde. However, the fact that Nora worked suggests that she is more responsible than others may think. It was rare at the time for middle class women like Nora to work, and the \u201cone or two other things\u201d she mentions is suspicious\u2014suggesting that there is more to her story than meets the eye. This is true, of course, because she also borrowed money.\n\n         \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde says she knows that Nora and Torvald spent a year in Italy, and Nora explains that, although it saved Torvald\u2019s life, it wasn\u2019t easy to go because it cost so much money. Mrs. Linde notes that it was lucky they had the money given the circumstances, and Nora says that they got it from her father, who died around the time that they left. Nora explains that, because she was heavily pregnant and taking care of Torvald, who was sick, she was unable to look after her father in his final days, and that this was the saddest thing that had happened to her during her marriage. Immediately after Nora\u2019s father\u2019s death, they left for Italy, and by the time they returned Torvald was completely cured and healthy again.\n \nThis passage shows the importance of money: not only does it afford freedom and comfort, but it saved Torvald\u2019s life. Nora\u2019s explanation that they borrowed the money is a lie, an act of deceit that no one knows about apart from Nora herself. However, the story of her father\u2019s death also shows that she was putting others before herself: both Torvald and her son, who she was pregnant with. The fact that she took care of Torvald instead of her beloved father shows that her marriage was her priority above everything.\n\n       \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde asks about Dr. Rank, wondering if his visit means Torvald is still in bad health. Nora explains that Dr. Rank is her and Torvald\u2019s best friend and that he visits once a day, and that she herself, Torvald, and their children are all perfectly healthy. She exclaims that she is so happy to be alive, before once again scolding herself for talking too much about herself.\n \nThe way Nora delights in her own family\u2019s health and good fortune in front of Mrs. Linde, whose husband has died and who is clearly struggling, is na\u00efve and insensitive. She seems to be aware that it is impolite to talk so much about her own life, but is unable to stop herself.\n \n\n\n \n\nNora asks if it is really true that Mrs. Linde did not love her husband, and why she married him. Mrs. Linde explains that she had to take care of her bedridden mother and two younger brothers and therefore felt she didn\u2019t have a choice. She tells Nora that her husband had been wealthy, but following his death his business fell apart and thus she was left with nothing. She says that she has spent the last three years struggling to survive by opening a shop and running a school, but that this is now over as her mother has died and her brothers are working themselves.\n \n\nMrs. Linde\u2019s story shows how difficult it was for women to survive without the financial support of men. The need for money effectively forced her to marry her husband, and after his death her struggle to support her family highlights the obstacles women faced in earning a reasonable income. Indeed, both Nora and Mrs. Linde\u2019s attempts to earn money were confined to work deemed appropriate for women\u2014embroidery, working in a school, etc.\n\n       \n \nNora says Mrs. Linde must feel relieved, but Mrs. Linde says she feels empty and purposeless because she has \u201cnobody to live for any more.\u201d She says she wanted to move in order to find a steady job, maybe in an office. Nora says that that kind of work is exhausting and Mrs. Linde would be better off taking a holiday, to which Mrs. Linde replies that she doesn\u2019t have a father she can fall back on for money. Mrs. Linde laments how easy it for someone in her position to become bitter and says she ends up only thinking about herself. She admits that she was happy to hear about Torvald\u2019s promotion because she hopes that he will help her find a job.\n \nBoth Nora and Mrs. Linde\u2019s lives show that women were supposed to find a sense of purpose in serving others. Without a husband and family to take care of, Mrs. Linde feels empty and worries about being selfish. Mrs. Linde\u2019s hope of working in an office shows a desire for independence not normally afforded to women. Nora\u2019s comment that this would be \u201cexhausting\u201d suggests she believes that such work is not appropriate for women.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora promises to help",

Mrs. Linde thanks her, saying Nora\u2019s behavior is exceptionally kind considering Nora hasn\u2019t had to struggle much herself. Nora is shocked by the accusation and says that she has had to put up with more than Mrs. Linde may realize. She says Mrs. Linde is just like everyone else who doesn\u2019t think she is responsible enough to handle serious matters. She reveals that in everything she has told Mrs. Linde there is a \u201cbig thing\u201d that she has concealed.\n \nNora is clearly frustrated with not being taken seriously by others. Ironically, this frustration leads her to act rather irresponsibly, as she decides to tell Mrs. Linde the secret she has been concealing from everyone else.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora mentions that Mrs. Linde is proud of having been able to look after her mother and brothers, and says that she too has something to be proud of. Before revealing what it is, Nora implores Mrs. Linde to be quiet and says that nobody must find out about it. She then explains that she was the one who saved Torvald\u2019s life. Although everyone thinks that the money for the trip to Italy came from Nora\u2019s father, Nora reveals that it was in fact she herself who raised it. Mrs. Linde is shocked and asks how it was possible, wondering if Nora won a sweepstake.\n \nBoth Nora and Mrs. Linde find joy in being able to provide for their families; this is both an adherence to the traditional role of women as selfless nurturers and a rejection of the notion that women shouldn\u2019t have financial independence. Nora\u2019s revelation of the truth of how she got the money is a crucial turning point in the play; it is the first step in the total unraveling of her secret.\n\n         \n \n\n \nNora at first won\u2019t reveal how she acquired the money, delighting in keeping Mrs. Linde in suspense. Mrs. Linde says it can\u2019t be possible for Nora to have borrowed the money, because a woman cannot do that without her husband\u2019s consent. Nora hints that if the woman has \u201ca sense for business\u201d it might be possible, but also says that she may or may not have borrowed it. She says that, considering how attractive she is, an admirer could have given it to her. Mrs.\nLinde chastises her for being silly.\n \nNora\u2019s joy in slowly and mysteriously revealing her secret suggests that she does not in fact take the matter that seriously, undermining her claim of being responsible. Mrs. Linde\u2019s guesses at how she may have got the money show how limited the options were for women who wished to earn money independently of their husbands.\n\n       \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde, worried, asks if Nora has done something rash. Nora says that she saved her husband\u2019s life, something that couldn\u2019t be considered rash. Mrs. Linde replies that, regardless of circumstances, acting behind her husband\u2019s back is a rash move. Nora explains that the \u201cwhole point\u201d was that Torvald wasn\u2019t supposed to know how ill he was nor how Nora acquired the money for the Italy trip. She says she tried to convince him to go without revealing the gravity of his illness, but that Torvald thought she was being frivolous and refused.\n \nMrs. Linde\u2019s adamant condemnation of any deceit between husband and wife, no matter the circumstances, reflects society\u2019s inflexible rules regarding marriage and gender roles. From Nora\u2019s perspective, her deceit was justified, as it saved Torvald\u2019s life. Her difficulty in getting Torvald to agree to the trip suggests he does not trust her intelligence and ability to make rational decisions.\n\n         \n \nMrs. Linde asks if Torvald ever found out about the money, and if Nora ever confided in him. Nora says he never found out, and that she would never say anything because Torvald is proud and would be humiliated by the thought that he owed his wife something. She explains that it would destroy their marriage. Mrs. Linde asks if she will ever tell Torvald the truth. At first, Nora says she may, but only after many years, when she is less attractive and Torvald is less in love with her. However, she cuts herself off, saying that would never happen.\n \nNora clearly believes it is quite possible to keep living with Torvald with the secret between them, and certainly a better option than revealing the truth. The suggestion that the truth would destroy their marriage is foreboding, and the first time Nora and Torvald\u2019s marriage seems anything less than perfectly secure.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora asks what Mrs. Linde thinks of her now that she knows about her secret, and seems to think that Mrs. Linde\u2019s opinion of her will have improved. Before Mrs. Linde can answer, though, Nora explains that there is something that has been worrying her. She says that she\u2019s always been able to meet the installment deadlines for paying back the debt by saving money out of her own allowance. She was not able to take money out of the housekeeping or the children\u2019s clothes, as both these needed to be of high quality. She explains that whenever Torvald gave her money to spend on herself, she always only spent half of what he gave her, and admits that was difficult.\n \nNora expects Mrs. Linde to respect her more now that she knows about the money, yet Mrs. Linde\u2019s shock at the fact that Nora lied to her husband suggests this might not be the case. Nora\u2019s explanation of how she got the money does show that she is not as much of a \u201cspendthrift\u201d as the other characters seem to think, and the fact that she only took the money from her own allowance highlights a sense of self-sacrifice that shows her act of deceit was truly selfless.\n\n         \n \n\n \nNora goes on to explain that she supplemented the savings from her allowance by doing copying work at night. She says that it made her very tired but that it was nonetheless fun to work and earn money and that it was \u201calmost like being a man.\u201d Mrs. Linde asks how much Nora has been able to pay off and Nora admits that she\u2019s not sure; she has simply focused on paying the installments when she needs to. She then tells Mrs. Linde that she would daydream about inheriting the fortune of a rich old man who was in love with her. Mrs. Linde, confused, asks who the man is, and Nora explains it is only a fantasy. She goes on to say that she doesn\u2019t bother thinking about a rich old man anymore as her troubles have ended. She talks about how wonderful it would be to be carefree and only have to think about doing things for Torvald and enjoying her time with the children.\n \nNora has mixed feelings about her decision to borrow money. On the one hand, she tells Mrs. Linde about how much she has suffered and the stress of finding secret ways of paying it back; on the other, she is very proud of her own resourcefulness and enjoys earning her own money. She seems to envy the independence that men have.\nThe fact that she doesn\u2019t know how much she has paid off, as well as her dream about the rich old man, show that she is not dealing with the debt in an entirely responsible way. Her description of what she hopes her life will soon be like shows that at this point, what she wants most is to carry out her duties as a wife and mother without worry.\n\n         \n \n\n \nThe doorbell rings. The maid announces that it is someone to see Torvald, but that she isn\u2019t sure whether to show him in yet as Torvald is still with Dr. Rank. Nora asks who it is, and Nils Krogstad announces himself. Mrs. Linde gasps and turns away. Nora asks in a tense murmur what Krogstad wants with Torvald. Krogstad replies that he wants to talk to Torvald about bank matters as they both work at the bank. Nora hesitates, but after Krogstad insists that he is here on routine business matters only, Nora tells him to go to Torvald\u2019s study.\n \nBoth Mrs. Linde and Nora have strange and suspicious reactions to Krogstad\u2019s arrival. Thus when Krogstad claims he is here on \u201croutine\u201d business matters, we are inclined to believe there is more to the story.\n\n   \n \nMrs. Linde asks Nora who it was at the door. Nora replied that it was Krogstad. Mrs. Linde reveals that she used to know Krogstad many years before and says he\u2019s changed a lot since then. Nora explains that his marriage wasn\u2019t happy, that his wife has died and that he has many children. Mrs. Linde asks Nora if it\u2019s true that Krogstad does business \u201con the side.\u201d Nora answers vaguely, saying she doesn\u2019t know and that they should change the subject.\n \nThere are several parallels between Krogstad and Mrs. Linde. Both had unhappy marriages, which have now ended after the death of their partner. Additionally, both have been visibly changed by their past. Nora\u2019s vagueness about Krogstad\u2019s side business dealings shows she is not ready to tell Mrs. Linde everything yet.\n\n     \n \n\n \nDr. Rank enters. Nora introduces him to Mrs. Linde. Mrs. Linde says they came in to the house together, but that she went slower than him as she has difficulty carrying things up the stairs. Dr. Rank asks if she has a disability, to which Mrs. Linde replies that she is only a little run down. Dr. Rank asks if she has come to town for a holiday, but Mrs. Linde says she is here to work. Dr. Rank jokingly asks if work is a \u201csovereign remedy\u201d for being run down. Mrs. Linde replies: \u201cOne must live, Doctor.\u201d\n \nDr. Rank and Mrs. Linde\u2019s conversation reveals tensions to do with class and gender between them. Like Nora, Dr. Rank believes that Mrs. Linde should be taking a holiday. They fail to realize that it is necessary for her to work in order to survive, a situation women were not supposed to find themselves in.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora, breaking the tension, says that Dr. Rank is as keen to live as anybody. Dr. Rank says yes, that he, along with all his patients, wish to \u201clet things drag on as long as possible,\u201d even if they are miserable. He notes that one example of someone who thinks like this is the man with Torvald. Nora asks what he means and Dr. Rank replies that it is a man called Krogstad who is \u201crotten to the core,\u201d and that Nora wouldn\u2019t know him. Nora asks what he is talking to Torvald about, and Dr. Rank replies that it was something to do with the bank. Nora says she didn\u2019t know that Krogstad worked at the bank, and Dr. Rank says that there is a phenomenon of finding people who are morally corrupt and giving them decent jobs in order to keep an eye on them.\n \nDr. Rank\u2019s speech about life and \u201cletting things drag on\u201d foreshadows his eventual death. His description of Krogstad reveals society\u2019s harsh judgment of Krogstad\u2014that he is completely \u201crotten\u201d and that he does not deserve to have a decent job. Nora, meanwhile, pretends to not really know who Krogstad is, which further reveals the extent of her deceit.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora suddenly bursts out laughing and Dr. Rank inquires what she laughing about, asking if she knows what society is. Nora replies that she was laughing about something entirely different, and asks if everyone who works at the bank is now under Torvald\u2019s control. Dr. Rank, shocked, asks if that is what Nora is laughing about. Nora, smiling, tells Dr. Rank not to mind, but keeps talking happily to herself about how amusing it is that Torvald has power over so many people.\n \nNora\u2019s behavior here is rather childish; while Dr. Rank and Mrs. Linde are having a serious conversation, she bursts out laughing at her own thoughts. Dr. Rank responds by asking her patronizingly if she knows what society is, showing he, like the other characters, does not really respect her.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora offers Dr. Rank a macaroon. He says he thought they were forbidden in Nora\u2019s house. Nora lies that Mrs. Linde gave them to her, and when Mrs. Linde acts surprised, Nora quickly assures her that it\u2019s all right because she wasn\u2019t to know that Torvald banned them. Nora eats a macaroon and walks happily around the room, saying there\u2019s one thing she\u2019d like to do at that moment. She says it\u2019s something she\u2019d like to say to Torvald, something \u201cnot very nice.\u201d After probing from Mrs.\nLinde and Dr. Rank, she reveals that she would like to say \u201cdamn.\u201d Both Mrs. Linde and Dr. Rank are extremely shocked.\n \nThe macaroons are a symbol of Torvald\u2019s strictness and",

Nora lies that Mrs. Linde gave them to her, and when Mrs. Linde acts surprised, Nora quickly assures her that it\u2019s all right because she wasn\u2019t to know that Torvald banned them.

The fact that Torvald has banned Nora from eating them in the first place shows that he thinks of her like a child, not capable of making good decisions and in need of an external presence to moderate her behavior. Nora\u2019s desire to say \u201cdamn\u201d suggests she wants the freedom to disobey both Torvald and the rules of society.\n\n       \n \nTorvald enters and Nora quickly hides the macaroons. Nora asks if Torvald \u201cgot rid of\u201d Krogstad, and Torvald replies that yes, Krogstad has left. Nora introduces Torvald to Mrs. Linde and says that Mrs. Linde has come all the way to town to talk to Torvald. Mrs. Linde, embarrassed, tries to explain that that wasn\u2019t exactly true, but Nora interrupts her to say that Mrs.\nLinde would like a job, and that having heard Torvald had been made Bank Manager set off straight away. Nora asks if Torvald will give her a job, and, after checking that she is a widow and that she has business experience, Torvald says it is likely he can find something. Mrs. Linde thanks him.\n \nWhen Nora hides the macaroons it is clear that she is not as daring around Torvald as she would like to be. Nora introduces Mrs. Linde to Torvald in her usual blunt, childlike way, causing Mrs. Linde to feel embarrassed. The fact that Torvald checks if Mrs. Linde is a widow reminds us that only unmarried or widowed women are allowed the independence of being able to work in an office.\n\n     \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde, Torvald, and Dr. Rank all go to leave. As they go, Nora asks that they return that evening. The nursemaid and the children enter, and Nora runs excitedly to let them in. Nora kisses her children and asks Mrs. Linde: \u201caren\u2019t they lovely?\u201d Before Mrs. Linde replies, Torvald ushers her and Dr. Rank out, saying that the house is now \u201cunbearable for anybody except mothers.\u201d\n \nNora is clearly a very loving and devoted mother, which is a big contrast to Torvald\u2019s attitude towards the children. His belief that their presence makes the house \u201cunbearable\u201d shows that his role as a father does not carry the expectation of showing any love or affection to his children.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora talks to her children, who tell her what they\u2019ve been doing outside. The nursemaid offers to take the children\u2019s coats and hats off but Nora says she will do it, throwing the garments on the floor. Her children all talk at once to her. They play hide and seek; Nora hides under the table and pretends to frighten the children.\n \nNora\u2019s joy in playing with the children show that she is both a loving and devoted mother and that she is still somewhat childlike herself.\n\n \n \n\n \nThe door half opens. Krogstad stands in the doorway, waiting. Eventually he announces himself. Nora jumps up, startled, and asks what he wants. He says that someone left the door open to the house by accident. She tells him Torvald isn\u2019t home.\nKrogstad replies that he wants to talk to Nora. Nora tells her children to go to the nursemaid, and assures them that the \u201cstrange man\u201d won\u2019t do anything to her. Once the children are gone, she asks what Krogstad wants, as it is not the first of the month. He replies that it is Christmas Eve, and it depends on Nora what kind of Christmas she has.\n \nKrogstad\u2019s ominous, threatening presence is a stark contrast to the carefree delight of Nora and the children playing. This contrast shows the pervasive presence of Nora\u2019s secret and the negative effect that it could have on her life, even as she does not seem to know it. Nora\u2019s happy, childlike manner changes instantly as soon as she is talking to Krogstad; she becomes far more cold and serious.\n\n   \n \n\n \nKrogstad says that he saw Torvald walking down the street earlier with a lady. Nora asks if the lady was Mrs. Linde; Krogstad says it was, and explains that he used to know her. Nora says that she knew that, and Krogstad replies: \u201cOh, so you know all about it.\u201d He asks if Torvald is giving Mrs. Linde a job at the bank. At first Nora is offended, asking how dare Krogstad interrogate her, given that he is one of Torvald\u2019s subordinates. Eventually, however, she reveals that Torvald is indeed giving Mrs. Linde a job. She boasts that she influenced the decision, arguing that just because she is a woman doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t have influence.\n \nThere is some irony in the fact that Nora expects Krogstad to treat her with respect as she is above him in terms of class, while also telling him that just because she is a woman doesn\u2019t mean she is incapable of having influence. After all, there is a parallel between the two of them, as they are both subordinate to Torvald, and have been denied power by society.\n\n   \n \nKrogstad asks in a more polite tone if Nora will use her influence to his advantage. He explains that he needs Nora\u2019s help to keep his job at the bank. Nora, confused, asks who wants to take it from him. Krogstad, thinking she is playing ignorance, implies he is aware that Mrs. Linde is getting his job and says that he therefore knows who to thank for the fact that he is being fired. He asks Nora to use her influence to stop the whole thing happening. Nora insists that she has no influence. Krogstad points out that she just claimed to have influence, to which Nora replies that she didn\u2019t mean it and that she of course doesn\u2019t have influence over her husband.\n \nThis is the second time in a day that Nora has been asked to use her influence with Torvald in order to secure someone a job at the bank, showing the importance of the bank as a symbol of money, security and respectability in the lives of the characters. Her contradictory statements about whether or not she has \u201cinfluence\u201d highlight the ambiguous status of married women at the time; even Nora is not sure to what extent she can affect Torvald\u2019s decisions.\n\n       \n \n\n \nKrogstad says he knew Torvald in their student days and is sure he is no more \u201csteadfast\u201d than other married men. Nora, outraged, tells Krogstad he must leave if he talks disrespectfully of Torvald. Krogstad remarks that she has courage, and Nora replies that she\u2019s not frightened of him anymore, as after New Year the whole \u201cbusiness\u201d between them will be over. Krogstad says he will fight with his life for his job, but explains that it is not for the money. He tells Nora that a few years ago he got mixed up in \u201ca bit of trouble.\u201d He says although he didn\u2019t get in legal trouble it has made it difficult to get a job, and therefore he has been forced to do business on the side, like lending money to Nora. He explains that the job at the bank was the first step on the ladder of respectability, and that by firing him Torvald is kicking him off that ladder.\n \nSeveral characters in A Doll\u2019s House espouse the idea that a husband\u2019s job is to be \u201csteadfast\u201d in providing reason and keeping control of his wife\u2019s irrational whims. The suggestion that Torvald isn\u2019t \u201csteadfast\u201d is even taken as a terrible insult by Nora. Krogstad\u2019s story about the trouble he got into and his subsequent struggle to regain respectability shows the importance within society of having a decent job. This is also the first time that the other major example of deceit, the fraud committed by Krogstad, is introduced to the play.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora says she cannot help Krogstad; he insists that this is only because she doesn\u2019t want to, and that he has a way of forcing her. Nora, shocked, asks if he would tell Torvald about the debt. Krogstad suggests that he might, and Nora begins to cry, saying that the secret is her \u201cpride and joy\u201d and that it would be \u201chorribly unpleasant\u201d if Torvald heard about it from Krogstad. Krogstad asks if it would be merely unpleasant, and Nora tells him that if Torvald found out he would certainly not give Krogstad a job, but rather just pay off the rest of the money immediately.\n \nNora\u2019s mixed feelings about her secret are reflected in her confused reaction to the thought of Torvald finding out about it. On the one hand, she calls the secret her \u201cpride and joy\u201d; however, she is aware that there would be negative consequences if Torvald found out.\nThis confusion is the result of the fact that Nora is both proud of saving Torvald\u2019s life and worried about having gone behind his back.\n\n     \n \nKrogstad remarks that either Nora doesn\u2019t have a good memory or she doesn\u2019t know much about business. He then recalls each step of the story of how Nora got the loan from him. He reminds Nora that he promised to find the money to lend her on the condition that she and her father signed an IOU. Nora says yes, she and her father did sign the IOU. Krogstad agrees that Nora did bring back the IOU with the two signatures and that therefore he gave her the money. But he then reminds her that it had been at a difficult time for her, when her father was very ill, shortly before he died. Krogstad then asks Nora on what date her father died, and she tells him the 29 September. Krogstad reveals that the date next to Nora\u2019s father\u2019s signature was 2 October, three days after he died. Krogstad says the handwriting on the date was also not Nora\u2019s father\u2019s, but another, familiar handwriting. He suggests that perhaps Nora\u2019s father forgot to add a date and that someone else added the date afterwards, which he says would be acceptable, but asks her if the signature is truly her father\u2019s. Nora replies defiantly that no, it had in fact been her who signed her father\u2019s name.\n \nHere, Krogstad reveals that there is another layer to Nora\u2019s deceit; not only did she lie to Torvald (and everyone else) about where the money came from\u2014a domestic matter\u2014but she also committed forgery, an illegal act. This increases the stakes of anyone discovering her secret. It is also significant that Nora\u2019s act of fraud involved impersonating a man. In order to save Torvald\u2019s life, she had to act beyond the restrictions imposed on women and even had to pretend to be a man in order to secure her loan. This highlights the powerlessness of women in society at the time.\n\n     \n \n\n \nKrogstad tells Nora how dangerous it was for her to admit to signing her father\u2019s name, and says it would have been better if she had never gone on the trip. Nora protests, saying she didn\u2019t have a choice as Torvald\u2019s life was on the line. Krogstad asks her if she ever realized she was committing fraud; Nora replies that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered to her. Krogstad insists that she has no idea what she\u2019s done. He tells her that he committed a similar offence, and that it destroyed his reputation. Nora asks if Krogstad also risked everything to save his wife\u2019s life, but Krogstad only replies that the law doesn\u2019t take motives into account. Nora cannot believe that the law wouldn\u2019t make an exception for the fact that her father was dying and that Torvald could also have died. Krogstad tells her that he knows about business transactions, and that if he is \u201cpitched out\u201d again, Nora will be going down with him. He exits.\n \nIn this passage, the central moral dilemma of the play is put forward: was Nora right to lie and commit forgery if it saved her husband\u2019s life? Nora certainly believes that in this instance, the ends justified the means. However, as Krogstad points out, the law and the opinion of society are inflexible. At this point, Krogstad is certainly the antagonist of the play, manipulating and threatening Nora with the same unforgiving attitude of the rest of society.\nHowever, his motivation for doing so is that he has also been punished for committing fraud\u2014showing that society\u2019s harsh judgment causes people to turn against each other.\n\n         \n \n\n \nNora, alone, tells herself that Krogstad is just trying to scare her. The children stand in the doorway and tell her Krogstad has left. Nora urges them not to tell anyone about his visit. The children ask if she will play with them again, and Nora tells them she can\u2019t, ushering them out of the room. Alone again, she picks up her embroidery for a moment, before throwing it back down. She calls to the maid and asks her to bring her the Christmas tree. She mutters to herself: \u201cNo,",

She mutters to herself: \u201cNo, really, it\u2019s quite impossible!\u201d The maid brings the Christmas tree into the room, and Nora dismisses her.\n \nThe web of Nora\u2019s deceit grows larger as she asks her children to keep Krogstad\u2019s visit a secret. The fact that she says she can\u2019t play with the children is symbolic of the end of her carefree innocence. She is clearly working hard to convince herself that Krogstad is wrong and that she is not scared by what he has said. However, her fretful movements about the room and worried muttering to herself suggest she is actually very frightened.\n\n \n \nNora decorates the tree, still talking to herself, saying everything Krogstad has said is nonsense and that she will do anything Torvald wants her to. Torvald enters and asks if anybody has visited the house. Nora says there hasn\u2019t been anybody, and Torvald replies that he just saw Krogstad leaving the house. Nora says that yes, Krogstad was there for a moment, and Torvald says he can tell that Krogstad has asked Nora to put in a good word for him and pretend it was her idea. Nora admits that Torvald is right. Torvald, incredulous, asks why Nora made promises to \u201ca person like that,\u201d and why she lied to him. He tells her she must never do anything like it again: \u201cLittle song-birds must keep their pretty little beaks out of mischief.\u201d He concludes that they won\u2019t talk about it anymore.\n \nNora feels reassured by promising herself that she will be totally obedient to Torvald. However, as soon as he enters, she lies to him. His discovery of the lie creates tension as it seems momentarily that Nora\u2019s whole secret may unravel\u2014however, Torvald hardly lets Nora speak, instead dominating the conversation by scolding Nora and telling her what to do. His statement that they won\u2019t talk about the matter anymore shows he doesn\u2019t suspect there is any more to the situation that what he knows, which creates an atmosphere of suspense.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora continues to decorate the Christmas tree and tells Torvald she is excited for the Stenborgs\u2019 fancy dress ball on Boxing Day. Torvald replies that he is excited to see what \u201csurprise\u201d Nora got for him. Nora brushes it off, saying it\u2019s silly and that everything seems absurd and pointless. Torvald is surprised. Nora asks him if he\u2019s busy and what papers he\u2019s working on; Torvald replies he has been given authority to make changes in the bank\u2019s organization and personnel over the Christmas week. Nora begins to say that that is why \u201cpoor Krogstad\u201d is losing his job, but is interrupted by an annoyed \u201cHm!\u201d from Torvald.\n \nNora finds solace in the Christmas tree and the thought of the fancy dress ball, both symbols of innocent happiness. Torvald\u2019s question about the \u201csurprise\u201d Nora has for him has a double meaning; Torvald is referring to the present Nora has got him, however another \u201csurprise\u201d is the impending revelation of Nora\u2019s secret. The fact that Torvald is getting to work immediately on reorganizing the bank staff\u2014and firing Krogstad\u2014creates suspense.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora strokes Torvald\u2019s hair and says that if he weren\u2019t so busy she\u2019d ask him to give her advice on what her costume should be for the fancy dress ball, as no one has as good taste as him.\nTorvald replies that his \u201cimpulsive little woman\u201d is asking to be rescued, and Nora says she never gets anywhere without Torvald\u2019s help. Torvald agrees to help her.\n \nNora in her distress retreats into the role of the beautiful and submissive wife. By assuring Torvald how helpless she is and how she depends on him for everything, she ensures that she is in his good favor.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora casually asks what Krogstad\u2019s crime was. Torvald replies that it was forgery, and asks if Nora knows what that means. Nora suggests that perhaps Krogstad was forced by circumstances to commit his crime. Torvald replies that this is possible, but that it is more likely that he just \u201cdidn\u2019t think,\u201d and that he would not condemn a man for a single mistake if he were to honestly confess and receive his punishment. However, Torvald explains that Krogstad dodged the consequences of his crime by a \u201ccunning trick.\u201d\n \nHere the parallel between Nora and Krogstad becomes unquestionably clear. Nora advocates the same lack of judgment towards Krogstad that she hopes will be applied to her. At first, Torvald seems forgiving, however his abhorrence at the fact that Krogstad was dishonest about his crime creates suspense, as Nora has done the same thing.\n\n   \n \nTorvald says a man like Krogstad will forever have to lie, even to his own family, and that the worst part is the fact that \u201ca fog of lies like that\u201d spreads and infects children. He claims that as a lawyer he knows that most juvenile delinquents are the children of dishonest mothers. Nora asks why it is mothers in particular who have this affect. Torvald admits that fathers can have the same influence, but that it is mostly mothers. He says that Krogstad has been \u201cpoisoning\u201d his own children for years with lies and deceit, and that he feels sick in the presence of people like that. He asks that Nora shake hands on a promise not to put in any more good words for Krogstad. At first she hesitates, but eventually shakes Torvald\u2019s hand.\n \nTorvald\u2019s speech is obviously terrifying to Nora, who treasures her children and her role as a wife and mother above anything. It also makes clear the extent to which deceit was seen as a poison in society at the time. It is worth noting that Torvald talks about the children of corrupt mothers in particular, even though he is referring to Krogstad, a man. This shows the extent to which the responsibility of being a good parent lay far more on women than men.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora backs away from Torvald, saying she feels hot. Torvald gets up and says he must do some work, as well as think about Nora\u2019s costume, before dinner. He also implies that he will wrap up some money in gold paper to hang on the Christmas tree for Nora, as she requested. After laying his hand affectionately on her head, he exits.\n \nNora is visibly shaken from what Torvald has said and what she now imagines will happen if her secret is revealed. Torvald\u2019s affection to her creates further suspense, as it shows how oblivious he is to the reality of the situation.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora repeats to herself \u201cit\u2019s impossible.\u201d The nursemaid calls saying that the children keep asking if they can be let in to see their mother. Nora tells the nursemaid to not let them in, and the nursemaid closes the door. Alone and \u201cpale with terror,\u201d Nora cries out about poisoning her children and corrupting her home. She exclaims: \u201cIt could never, never be true!\u201d\n \nNora is terrified to the point that she even seems to be going mad. Her decision not to let the children in shows that she now believes she is a bad influence on them. Despite repeating \u201cit\u2019s not true,\u201d it is clear that Nora has taken to heart what Torvald has said.\n\n \n \n\n \nACT TWO\nThe curtain opens to the same room, with the Christmas tree now stripped and \u201cbedraggled.\u201d Nora\u2019s outdoor clothes are on the sofa, and Nora, who is alone, walks around restlessly, before picking up her coat. She says aloud that somebody is coming, listens, and then says that it is nobody. She tells herself that nobody will come that day, Christmas day, or the next. She checks the letterbox and finds nothing in there. She mutters to herself that \u201che\u201d didn\u2019t mean it seriously, and that \u201cthings like that can\u2019t happen.\u201d She adds, \u201cI have three small children.\u201d\n \n\n\nIn the opening of the second act, the stripped Christmas tree not only shows that time has passed, but also symbolizes a negative spiral from the domestic joy of Christmas to a sense of ruin and chaos. Nora\u2019s obsessive checking to see if any person or letter has arrived and assurances that no one will come for two days gives a sense of time running out and impending disaster.\n\n   \n \n\n \nThe nursemaid enters, carrying a large cardboard box. She announces that it is the box of fancy dress costumes and admits they are in a mess. Nora exclaims, \u201cif only I could rip them up into a thousand pieces!\u201d The nursemaid, taken aback, says they can be easily mended, and Nora says she will go and get Mrs.\nLinde to help. The nursemaid says if Nora goes out she will catch her death of cold, to which Nora replies \u201cworse things might happen.\u201d\n \nNora\u2019s behavior has become increasingly pessimistic and irrational, occasionally veering on resembling the Victorian archetype of the \u201chysterical,\u201d or insane woman. Nora\u2019s reply to the nursemaid\u2019s concern that she will catch her death of cold shows that the stress of her secret has caused her to will her own destruction.\n\n   \n \nNora asks how the children are, and the nursemaid replies that they are playing with their presents, and asking for their mother. Nora tells her she can\u2019t be with them as often as she was before, and asks if the nursemaid thinks they would forget about her if she went away for good. Nora asks the nursemaid how it was possible for her to hand over her children to strangers. The nursemaid replies that \u201cthere was nothing else for it\u201d when she was offered the job of nursing Nora, and says, \u201cWhen a poor girl\u2019s been in trouble she must make the best of things.\u201d She also refers to a man who didn\u2019t help her. Nora asks if the nursemaid\u2019s daughter has forgotten her, and the nursemaid responds that she hasn\u2019t, that she wrote to her when she was confirmed and again when she married. Nora hugs the nursemaid and tells her how good a mother she was, and the nursemaid remarks that Nora never had another mother. Nora begins to say: \u201cIf my little ones only had you, I know you would\u2026\u201d but cuts herself off, saying she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. She opens the cardboard box and tells the nursemaid to go to the children. The nursemaid exits, saying Nora will be the prettiest person at the ball.\n \nThe fact that Nora feels she can\u2019t be around her children \u201cas much as before\u201d shows that she has taken to heart Torvald\u2019s statement about dishonest mothers corrupting their children. The implication within the nursemaid\u2019s story is that the nursemaid was impregnated by an unnamed man who then refused to help her take care of the baby, thereby forcing her to give the child up while accepting the job as Nora\u2019s nurse. This narrative is another example, like Mrs. Linde\u2019s experience, of women being forced by circumstances to sacrifice their own happiness for others. The fact that Nora trusts the nursemaid to raise her children foreshadows her eventual decision to leave them and shows that she is not acting entirely selfishly when she does leave, as she has already ensured they will be well taken care of.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora begins unpacking the box, but quickly throws it down. She mutters to herself about wanting to go out but feeling worried that something would happen at home while she was gone. She tells herself not to think about it, and counts out the \u201cpretty gloves\u201d to try and take her mind off it. She hears a sound, screams, and exclaims \u201cthey are coming.\u201d She goes off towards the door, stops, and sees Mrs. Linde in the hall, taking off her outdoor clothes. Nora greets her and asks if anyone else is there. She says she is glad Mrs. Linde has come.\n \nNora cannot think of anything else but her secret and the possibility of someone finding out. She tries to distract herself with the clothes\u2014significant because they are objects representing femininity\u2014but is unable to.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora tells Mrs. Linde she would like her help with her costume for the fancy dress party. She tells her that Torvald wants her to go as a Neopolitan fisher lass and dance the tarantella, which she learned while she was in Italy. She shows her the costume that Torvald had made for her in Italy, and says that it\u2019s torn.\nMrs. Linde says she can fix it, and says she will stop by to see Nora in her finery. She thanks Nora for a pleasant time the previous",

She tries to distract herself with the clothes\u2014significant because they are objects representing femininity\u2014but is unable to.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora tells Mrs. Linde she would like her help with her costume for the fancy dress party. She tells her that Torvald wants her to go as a Neopolitan fisher lass and dance the tarantella, which she learned while she was in Italy. She shows her the costume that Torvald had made for her in Italy, and says that it\u2019s torn.\nMrs. Linde says she can fix it, and says she will stop by to see Nora in her finery. She thanks Nora for a pleasant time the previous evening, but Nora replies that she doesn\u2019t think it was as pleasant \u201cas things normally are,\u201d and that Mrs. Linde should have come to town a little earlier.\n \nNora often talks about how much Torvald likes to see her sing and dance, and the fact that Torvald calls her his \u201cskylark\u201d and \u201csongbird\u201d and wants her to dance the Tarantella shows that to a certain extent Nora \u201cperforms\u201d her role in the marriage. Nora\u2019s comment that the previous night wasn\u2019t as pleasant as things normally are shows the threads of her ordinary life are unraveling.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora remarks that Torvald knows how to make the home nice, and Mrs. Linde says that Nora does too, suggesting it is a trait she inherited from her father. Mrs. Linde then comments on how depressed Dr. Rank seemed the night before, and Nora explains that he has tuberculosis of the spine. She says that his father was a terrible man who had mistresses and that Dr. Rank has always been unwell, ever since childhood. Mrs. Linde asks how she knows this, and Nora pauses, before telling her she heard it from the gossiping nurses who came to the house to care for her when she gave birth.\n \nMrs. Linde\u2019s comment about Nora and her father and Nora\u2019s story about Dr. Rank and his father shows how strong the influence of parents was believed to be on children. Nora\u2019s unsure answer to Mrs. Linde\u2019s question about where she heard about Dr. Rank\u2019s story suggests she may be lying again.\n\n   \n \nNora explains that Dr. Rank was Torvald\u2019s best friend as a boy and is also a good friend of hers, with emphasis on the word mine. Mrs. Linde asks if Dr. Rank is genuine, explaining that when they met he told her that he\u2019d heard her name around the house often, but that this couldn\u2019t be true as Torvald didn\u2019t know who she was. Nora explains: \u201cTorvald is so terribly in love with me that he wants me all to himself.\u201d She says it used to make him jealous to hear her mention her old friends. She adds that Dr. Rank likes hearing about them, though, so she talks to him.\n \nAs the play progresses, it becomes more and more clear how possessive Torvald is. Nora\u2019s pride at saying Dr. Rank is \u201cher\u201d friend suggests she doesn\u2019t really have many friends now that she is married. Nora believes that the reason that Torvald is so controlling is because he is so in love with her; this shows there is a tenuous distinction between a loving marriage and a controlling one.\n\n   \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde chastises Nora, saying she is still a child and that she must stop \u201call this business with Dr. Rank.\u201d Mrs. Linde recalls Nora\u2019s dream about having a rich old admirer. She asks if Dr.\nRank has money, and Nora says that he does. Mrs. Linde reveals that she believes Dr. Rank lent her the money for the Italy trip. Nora is shocked, saying it would be intolerable to owe Dr. Rank money, given that he is a friend and comes over every day. She says he didn\u2019t inherit money until more recently, and that it never would have occurred to her to ask him for the loan. She begins to wonder what would happen if she did ask Dr. Rank for money, but Mrs. Linde interrupts her, exclaiming: \u201cBehind your husband\u2019s back?\u201d Nora says she must get herself out of the first debt, which is also behind her husband\u2019s back. She remarks that men are better at coping with \u201cthese things\u201d than women.\n \nMrs. Linde\u2019s belief that Nora must have borrowed the money from Dr. Rank shows that there was a certain degree of suspicion surrounding friendships between people of the opposite gender.\nMrs. Linde\u2019s continued shock at the fact that Nora is acting behind Torvald\u2019s back shows the extent to which society would condemn Nora\u2019s behavior. Nora attributes her confusion and sense of helplessness to the fact that she is out of her depth as a woman, showing that, at least to a certain extent, she believes in the idea that women are less capable than men.\n\n         \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde points out that Nora\u2019s own husband would be able to cope with the matter, but Nora responds: \u201cNonsense!\u201d She asks Mrs. Linde if, after a debt is repaid, the IOU is returned to the payer. Mrs. Linde tells her yes, and Nora cries out that then one can tear it up into a thousand pieces and burn it. Mrs. Linde says to Nora that she knows there\u2019s something Nora is not telling her. Nora asks if it\u2019s that obvious, and seems like she is about to tell Mrs. Linde more, but is interrupted by the sound of Torvald returning. She tells Mrs. Linde to wait in the other room with the children, because Torvald can\u2019t stand to see mending lying around the house. Mrs. Linde gathers her things together and tells Nora she won\u2019t leave until she\u2019s found out what Nora is hiding from her. She exits.\n \nNora, despite having claimed that men cope better with matters of business than women, still feels that she needs to hide the issue of the debt from Torvald, in what is almost a protective gesture. The fact that Mrs. Linde can so easily tell that Nora is keeping something from her does not bode well for Nora\u2019s desire to keep her secret from Torvald and the rest of society. Torvald\u2019s dislike of seeing mending lying around relates to his earlier comment about the children making the house unbearable; he seems to have a dislike for everything related to femininity.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora goes to meet Torvald and says she\u2019s been \u201clonging\u201d for him to come back. She explains that Mrs. Linde was helping her with her outfit and Torvald asks what a good idea of his it was for Nora to wear that costume. Nora agrees, and adds it was nice of her to let him have his way. Torvald holds Nora\u2019s chin, calling her a \u201clittle rogue\u201d and acting surprised that she would think of it as \u201cnice,\u201d considering he is her husband. He says he knows she didn\u2019t mean it that way, however, and says he won\u2019t disturb her anymore. He says he also has work to do, and turns to go to his study.\n \nNora has an almost sycophantic attitude towards Torvald at this stage in the play; the way she acts around him is, at the very least, unnatural. Their marriage begins to seem more and more like a performance, and the connection between them less and less genuine. Meanwhile, Torvald continues to treat Nora like a child; the gesture of grabbing her chin is similar to the body language between parent and child.\n\n     \n \nNora stops him, and asks that if \u201ca little squirrel\u201d (referring to herself) asked nicely would he do something for \u201cit.\u201d Torvald replies that he would first need to know what the favor was, but Nora ignores him, saying that if he let her have her way she would scamper and do \u201cmarvelous tricks\u201d and sing. She adds that she would pretend to be an elfin child and dance \u201ca moonlight dance.\u201d\n \nNora attempts to manipulate Torvald using the kind of play- language he adopts when he is speaking affectionately to her. Her comments about singing and dancing and doing tricks add to the idea of performing her role as a wife, and the reference to the elfin child shows she is willing to adopt the role of a child.\n\n   \n \n\n \nTorvald says he hopes Nora is not referring to the conversation they had that morning about letting Krogstad keep his job.\nNora says she is, and begs Torvald to let her have her way. She asks that Torvald give Mrs. Linde somebody else\u2019s job. Torvald, outraged, says he will not act on Nora\u2019s \u201cthoughtless promise\u201d to Krogstad. Nora replies that she is terrified of Krogstad, who can do Torvald harm because he writes in all the \u201cnastiest\u201d papers. Torvald asks if it is the memory of what happened to her father that is making Nora scared and Nora, at first uncertainly, agrees, saying that rumors about her father almost cost him is career. Torvald replies that Nora\u2019s father\u2019s professional life was \u201cnot entirely above suspicion,\u201d which is unlike the conduct of Torvald himself, and that therefore Nora need not worry.\n \nNora, trapped in more and more layers of lying and deceit, is unable to properly communicate with Torvald. Meanwhile, Torvald clearly has no interest in taking Nora\u2019s opinion seriously, saying whatever promise she made was \u201cthoughtless\u201d. Instead, he only wishes to calm and reassure her, like a child. Further, he is unafraid of admitting in front of Nora that he believes her father was not totally honorable in his business career, showing a disregard for her feelings.\n\n       \n \n\n \nNora insists that Krogstad is capable of great evil, implying he could destroy the peace and happiness of hers and Torvald\u2019s home. Torvald says that the more Nora tries to persuade him, the less likely it is he will agree. He tells her about the embarrassment he would experience if anyone found out that he had been influenced by his wife, saying it would make him \u201cthe laughing stock of the office.\u201d\n \nThe implication here is that Torvald cares more about his reputation within society than about Nora\u2019s thoughts and feelings. The low status of women at the time is conveyed by the fact that if a man was thought to have been influenced by his wife he would be made a laughing stock.\n\n       \n \n\n \nTorvald says that there is another reason, separate from Krogstad\u2019s history of bad behavior that makes him unable to let him keep his job. He tells Nora that he and Krogstad were friends in their youth, which he says was rash and now embarrasses him. Torvald explains that, because of their past friendship, Krogstad treats him with familiarity and \u201cas an equal\u201d in public. He tells Nora that this makes it intolerable to have Krogstad working at the Bank. Nora, surprised, remarks that this seems petty. Torvald, infuriated, calls the maid and gives her a letter from his papers and instructs her to deliver it immediately. The maid exits, and Torvald tells a panicked Nora that the letter was Krogstad\u2019s notice.\n \nTorvald\u2019s speech about his embarrassment about being treated as an equal by Krogstad is rather irrational\u2014it is Nora who provides reason when she accuses him of being petty. It also reveals how important it is to Torvald to feel like he has a high status in society and power over other people, which explains much of his behavior to Nora. Thus a connection is made between Torvald\u2019s bad treatment of Nora and his bad treatment of Krogstad\u2014they are both oppressed by either their gender or class.\n\n       \n \nNora desperately begs Torvald to get the letter back, for the sake of himself and the children. She tells him he doesn\u2019t know what the letter could do. Torvald replies that it is too late, and says he is slightly insulted that Nora believes that Krogstad\u2014\u201cthis miserable pen-pusher\u201d\u2014would have any power over him. However, he concedes that he finds it sweet because it shows how much Nora loves him, and assures her that he is \u201cman enough\u201d to handle everything himself. Nora says that that is something he will never do, to which Torvald affectionately responds that they will share it, man and wife. He caresses her and asks if she is happy, remarking that she looks like a frightened dove. He suggests she run through the tarantella while he is in his study with both doors shut so he can\u2019t hear anything. He tells her that when Dr. Rank arrives she should tell him to go to Torvald\u2019s study, and exits.\n \nIn this passage Torvald clearly has no understanding of the actual situation, but is so intent on being in control and asserting his capability as a man to handle everything that he is unable to perceive that there is actually a great deal at stake. While he does seem to want to make Nora happy, even willing to offer the concession of saying that they will deal with problems together as a couple, he fails to take her terror seriously or believe anything she says to him. Again, the tarantella\u2014a dance\u2014occurs as a symbol of Nora happily performing her role in their marriage.\n\n         \n \n\n \nNora, alone and \u201cwild-eyed with terror,\u201d talks to herself, trying to decide whether Krogstad is capable of acting on his threat. She cries out \u201chelp\u201d and asks aloud if there is a way out. The doorbell",

She cries out \u201chelp\u201d and asks aloud if there is a way out. The doorbell rings, and she sees that it is Dr. Rank. She lets Dr. Rank in and tells him that Torvald is busy at the moment and not to go into his study yet, but says that she always has time for him.\n \nNora seems increasingly desperate and crazed. Her mutterings to herself when she is alone punctuate the scenes with other characters, showing the effect that concealing her secret in front of others is having on her. She lies easily to Dr. Rank, showing how natural lying has become.\n \n\n\n \n\nDr. Rank says he will keep taking advantage of the ability to talk to Nora as long as he is able. Nora, taken aback, asks what he means, and Dr. Rank explains that his health is declining. Nora breathes a sigh of relief at the knowledge that it is Dr. Rank himself who he is suggesting will not be around for much longer. Dr. Rank explains that he is very ill, and that within a month he will probably be dead. Dr. Rank asks a favor of Nora, telling her that Torvald is sensitive and he does not want him to visit him as he dies. He promises to send his visiting card with a black cross on it when he knows he is in his final days.\n \n\nNora\u2019s relief when she finds out that Dr. Rank is saying he will die soon, and not that anything bad will happen to her, is childish and shows her selfish side. At this stage in the play, her fixation with her own fate makes her unable to properly connect with the world or feel any sympathy for Dr. Rank. Dr. Rank\u2019s request that Torvald not see him as he dies is another instance of someone feeling the need to protect Torvald\u2014showing Torvald may not be as strong as he claims.\n\n \n \n\n \nNora tells Dr. Rank he is being absurd, saying she hoped he would be in a good mood. Dr. Rank replies that it is unlikely he would be in a good mood with death looming. He adds that he no longer wants to suffer for another man\u2019s sins, and that a similar situation must be happening in every family. Nora stops her ears and exclaims that Dr. Rank is talking nonsense. But Dr. Rank continues, saying he and his spine are having to pay for his father\u2019s hedonist life. He lists all the lavish foods his father ate, including oysters, truffles, and champagne, and Nora says it\u2019s a shame that such delicious foods attack the spine.\n \nNora\u2019s refusal to deal with the reality of the fact that Dr. Rank is dying is further example of her childish behavior. Dr. Rank\u2019s speech about how he is paying for his father\u2019s sins aggressively reinforces the guilt Nora is experiencing\u2014however, the passage about the different foods highlights the illogicality and unscientific basis of the belief that the behavior of parents can so drastically affect their children.\n\n   \n \nSuddenly, Nora asks Dr. Rank why he smiled, and Dr. Rank replies that it was in fact Nora who laughed. Dr. Rank calls her a \u201crascal\u201d and Nora admits she is feeling mischievous that day.\nNora asks Dr. Rank not to \u201cgo and die on Torvald and me.\u201d Dr. Rank says he won\u2019t be missed for long, and speaks with jealousy of the fact that Mrs. Linde seems like a replacement of him, as she is now in the house so often. Nora urges him not to talk so loud as Mrs. Linde is in the other room; Dr. Rank argues that this proves his point.\n \nNora is behaving in a cheekily childish way, however there is also an element of flirtation between her and Dr. Rank. Dr. Rank\u2019s jealousy at how often Mrs. Linde is around mirrors the jealousy Nora describes Torvald experiencing when she spoke about her old friends, highlighting a shared possessiveness between the two men.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora tells Dr. Rank to cheer up and promises that he\u2019ll see her dance tomorrow and he can pretend that she is dancing just for him, before quickly adding, \u201cand for Torvald as well, of course.\u201d She brings him over to the costume box and shows him the flesh-colored silk stockings, at first saying that he may only look at the feet before adding that maybe he can look higher up and asking if he thinks they\u2019ll fit. Dr. Rank says he cannot answer, and Nora slaps him playfully with the stockings. Dr. Rank asks if there are other \u201cdelights\u201d he can see, but Nora replies he\u2019s \u201ctoo naughty\u201d to see anything else.\n \nHere the level of flirtation between Nora and Dr. Rank reaches a level that would have been fairly scandalous at the time. When Nora teases Dr. Rank with the stockings, this can be taken as an explicitly sexual gesture. Her promise to dance for him likewise betrays a disregard for the boundaries of her marriage and a delight in flaunting her femininity and sexuality.\n\n     \n \n\n \nDr. Rank muses that he couldn\u2019t imagine what would have happened to him if he\u2019d never encountered Torvald and Nora and become a regular visitor in their house. He laments the fact that he will soon no longer be able to see them and that he has no way of expressing his gratitude to them. At first, Nora responds by saying it is nonsense to suggest that Dr. Rank is going to leave. However, she soon begins to hesitantly ask if he would do her a large favor. Dr. Rank responds that he would do anything. Nora is unsure, but Dr. Rank assures her that the bigger the favor the better, and asks if Nora trusts him. Nora admits that she trusts him more than anyone else she knows.\n \nSuddenly, Dr. Rank\u2019s impending death has become an opportunity for Nora to acquire his assistance in preventing Torvald finding out about the debt, something she had earlier sworn to Mrs. Linde that she would never do. Nora\u2019s statement that she trusts Dr. Rank more than anyone she knows is surprising, as it suggests she trusts him more than Torvald; Nora\u2019s and Torvald\u2019s marriage seems less and less solid by the minute.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora tells Dr. Rank that there is something he must help her prevent happening. She tells him how passionately Torvald loves her and says he would surely lay down his life for her. Before she can continue, Dr. Rank asks if Nora thinks Torvald is the only one who would give his life for her. Nora is upset, but Dr. Rank says he promised himself he would tell her before he died. Nora gets up and moves away from Dr. Rank, asking the maid to bring a lamp in. She tells Dr. Rank it was \u201chorrid\u201d of him to say what he just said.\n \nNora is on the brink of asking Dr. Rank to help with keeping the secret of the debt from Torvald, yet is stopped by his confession of love. The confession changes her demeanor entirely; where she perhaps thought flirtation was harmless, the fact that Dr. Rank seems to genuinely love her becomes too much to handle, and she retreats in a rather childlike way.\n\n   \n \nThe maid enters with the lamp, before exiting again. Dr. Rank asks if Nora knew that he loved her, and she replies that she can\u2019t tell whether she knew or not. Dr. Rank says that now she knows that he will do anything for her, but Nora says she can\u2019t tell him anything now. Dr. Rank begs her to let him help her, but she refuses, eventually claiming that she never needed help.\nShe asks if Dr. Rank feels ashamed of himself in the light of the lamp. He says no, but asks if he should go and not return. Nora tells him to keep visiting them as usual, as she and Torvald would both miss him otherwise.\n \nNora\u2019s manner of speaking in a self-contradictory way becomes more and more obvious in this scene. She is first flirtatious with Dr. Rank, asking him for a favor; she then says she cannot tell him anything or ask for his help. She then further contradicts herself by saying that she never needed help in the first place. She seems upset and offended by Dr. Rank\u2019s confession of love, but when he asks to go, she tells him not to.\n\n   \n \n\n \nDr. Rank explains that he can\u2019t figure Nora out, and that it\u2019s often felt to him that she\u2019d just as rather be with him as with Torvald. Nora responds by saying that \u201cthere are those people you love and those people you\u2019d almost rather be with.\u201d She explains that when she was younger, she loved her father best, but would also love to sneak into the maid\u2019s room because they didn\u2019t preach at her and talked about interesting things. She admits that living with Torvald is in some ways like living with her father.\n \nDr. Rank\u2019s comments suggest that Nora has a history of flirting with him, and that she is perhaps not as committed to Torvald as it may have seemed. The comparison Nora draws between being married to Torvald and living with her father shows the extent of Torvald\u2019s paternalistic control of her, and indicates that Nora is frustrated by this treatment.\n\n       \n \n\n \nThe maid enters, whispers something to Nora and hands her a visiting card. Nora, looking at the card, exclaims. When Dr. Rank asks if something is wrong, she says it is her new costume. Dr. Rank, confused, says he thought her costume was in the other room. Nora says she\u2019s ordered another one and that Torvald must not know about it. She tells Dr. Rank to go and see Torvald and keep him distracted. Dr. Rank promises to do so and exits.\n \nAlthough momentarily it seemed like Nora was going to confide in Dr. Rank, this exchange reveals that he is now merely another person who she must lie to and who she feels she cannot trust. As the play progresses, Nora becomes increasingly isolated as a character, separated by more and more secrets.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora asks the maid if \u201che\u201d (Krogstad) is in the kitchen. The maid replies that he came up the back stairs and that even though she told him nobody was home he refused to leave until he saw Nora. Nora instructs the maid to let Krogstad in but not to tell anybody about it as it\u2019s a surprise for Torvald. The maid agrees and exits.\n \nKrogstad\u2019s determination and disregard for etiquette is alarming, as it shows he is desperate. Meanwhile, Nora must cover her tracts in front of everyone\u2014even the maid\u2014increasing her isolation.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora remarks to herself that Krogstad is coming and that this is what she has been dreading. She locks the door to Torvald\u2019s study. Krogstad enters in a fur coat and cap. Nora tells him to keep his voice down as Torvald is at home. She asks Krogstad what he wants with her, and he replies \u201cto find out something.\u201d He tells her he\u2019s been given his notice, and Nora replies that she tried to prevent it but there was nothing she could do.\nKrogstad asks if Torvald doesn\u2019t care about Nora, considering he knows what would happen if Krogstad is fired. Nora replies that Torvald doesn\u2019t know, and Krogstad says that that makes sense as it would be unlike Torvald to be so courageous.\n \nIt is becoming increasingly clear that Nora\u2019s adamant refusal to tell Torvald the truth is not going to work in her favor. Her secretiveness is clearly unsustainable, and Krogstad\u2019s comments show that he does not believe she will be able to keep the secret any longer.\nKrogstad\u2019s low opinion of Torvald, instead of seeming merely insulting, may now seem indicative of Torvald\u2019s true nature.\n\n   \n \nKrogstad asks if Nora has a clearer idea of her crime than she did yesterday. She replies bitterly that she does, and Krogstad says that he just wanted to check where things stood. He mentions that even he is not unfeeling, and Nora asks him in that case to show mercy and think of her children. He suggests that neither she nor Torvald thought of his children when Torvald fired him. He says that he won\u2019t make any moves at the moment, that everything can be settled in a friendly way, and that only he, Torvald, and Nora must know. Nora remains adamant that her husband won\u2019t know, but Krogstad explains that unless Nora herself has the money to pay off the rest of what she owes him, Torvald will have to find out.\n \nThis passage shows us that there is perhaps a more reasonable side to Krogstad than we may have earlier thought. When Nora asks him for mercy and to think of her children, his point that neither she nor Torvald thought of his children is fairly valid. His offer to resolve the matter between him, Nora and Torvald is also not in itself particularly unreasonable; however, Nora\u2019s steadfastness makes her unable to see this.\n\n       \n \n\n \nKrogstad explains that, even if the remainder of the debt is paid off, he will still keep the",

Nora remains adamant that her husband won\u2019t know, but Krogstad explains that unless Nora herself has the money to pay off the rest of what she owes him, Torvald will have to find out.\n \nThis passage shows us that there is perhaps a more reasonable side to Krogstad than we may have earlier thought. When Nora asks him for mercy and to think of her children, his point that neither she nor Torvald thought of his children is fairly valid. His offer to resolve the matter between him, Nora and Torvald is also not in itself particularly unreasonable; however, Nora\u2019s steadfastness makes her unable to see this.\n\n       \n \n\n \nKrogstad explains that, even if the remainder of the debt is paid off, he will still keep the IOU. He tells Nora that if she is thinking of running away, or doing something worse, that she should forget it, as he will be in the possession of the IOU and, by implication, Nora\u2019s reputation. Nora asks how he knew that she was considering \u201canything worse\u201d (suicide)? Krogstad says that everyone in situations like this thinks of that, including himself, but that he wasn\u2019t brave enough to go through with it. Nora admits that she isn\u2019t either. Krogstad seems relieved.\n \nThis part of the conversation shows the importance of reputation in society at the time. A person\u2019s reputation is seen as the most valuable thing; in some ways even more valuable than their life.\nKrogstad\u2019s revelation that he also considered suicide further emphasizes the parallel between him and Nora.\n\n     \n \n\n \nKrogstad reveals that he has a letter already written to Torvald explaining the situation. Nora insists that Torvald must never read the letter and tells Krogstad to tear it up. She asks how much money Krogstad is asking of Torvald, and Krogstad explains that he\u2019s not asking for any money; instead he wants to be on his feet again and to \u201cget to the top.\u201d He says he\u2019s been going straight for a year and a half, but after being fired is no longer content to work his way slowly to the top. He tells Nora that Torvald must make a new vacancy at the bank, a better job than Krogstad had before, and offer it to him. Nora cries out that Torvald would never do that, but Krogstad is confident Torvald would \u201cwithout so much as a whimper.\u201d He promises that in a year he will be Torvald\u2019s right hand man and will eventually be running it instead of Torvald.\n \nKrogstad\u2019s determination to keep his respectability and stay on the \u201cstraight and narrow\u201d at first seem justified and almost admirable; however, his desire to oust Torvald and get to the top shows that he is struck by the same ambition and greed for money and status that affects Torvald. Krogstad\u2019s premonition that Torvald will give in to his demands \u201cwithout a whimper\u201d is correct\u2014Torvald even uses this exact phrase after reading the letter from Krogstad in the third act. Ironically, it turns out to be Krogstad who knows Torvald\u2019s character better than Nora.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora tells Krogstad that he will never live to see himself run the bank. Krogstad asks if Nora is threatening to kill him, and says he couldn\u2019t be afraid of \u201ca precious pampered little thing\u201d like her. He teases her about the idea of murder or suicide, before saying that nobody actually does things like that and that it wouldn\u2019t be of any use if Nora killed herself because her reputation would still be in Krogstad\u2019s hands, and Krogstad could use that to manipulate Torvald. Krogstad tells Nora not to do anything silly, and that he expects to hear from Torvald when he gets Krogstad\u2019s letter. He says he will never forgive Torvald for \u201cforcing me off the straight and narrow again,\u201d and says goodbye to Nora.\n \nThere are some elements to Nora\u2019s protectiveness of Torvald that might be thought of as masculine, for example, her threat to kill Krogstad. However, because she is a woman, Krogstad does not take her seriously, implying that she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about and could never be scary or violent.\n\n     \n \nNora watches Krogstad exit and sees him drop the letter in the letter box. She cries out Torvald\u2019s name and exclaims that it is hopeless. Mrs. Linde enters and announces that Nora\u2019s costume is mended. Nora beckons Mrs. Linde in a horse voice and shows her the letter in the letterbox, saying that it is from Krogstad. Mrs. Linde realizes that Krogstad lent Nora the money. Nora laments that now Torvald will know everything, and Mrs. Linde says it is better that way. Nora adds that she committed forgery; Mrs. Linde cries out in shock.\n \nKrogstad\u2019s exit triggers a new sense of inevitability to the eventuality of Torvald finding out about the debt. This provokes Nora to share the whole story with Mrs. Linde, giving the impression that she believes she has nothing to lose. As Mrs. Linde is the first one to know the whole story, this moment can be taken as the beginning of the gradual unwinding of Nora\u2019s deceit.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora asks Mrs. Linde to be her witness in case she goes mad or anything else happens which meant she couldn\u2019t be there anymore. Mrs. Linde, shocked, asks if Nora is out of her mind. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that if someone tries to take responsibility for her crime when Nora isn\u2019t there that Mrs.\nLinde must testify that it was Nora alone who was responsible. She insists that she is sane now and tells Mrs. Linde to remember what she said. Mrs. Linde says she will, even though she doesn\u2019t understand. Nora says something miraculous will happen, but that it would also be terrible. She then contradicts herself, saying it must never happen, no matter what.\n \nNora\u2019s behavior is indeed becoming increasingly strange, and her belief that she may go mad shows the extent to which the association between women and madness was ingrained in people at the time. Her mention of the vague miraculous event that she both does and doesn\u2019t want to happen increases the impression that she cannot envision a good ending to the situation.\n\n       \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde announces that she is going to talk to Krogstad. Nora asks her not to, saying Krogstad can only do her harm. Mrs. Linde responds that there was a time when he would have done anything for her, and asks where he is. Nora checks his card to see the address, but is interrupted by the sound of Torvald knocking on the door and saying Nora\u2019s name. Nora, terrified, asks what he wants. Torvald tells her not to be afraid and asks if she\u2019s trying the costume on, as she\u2019s locked the door. Nora replies that she is and that it looks great on her. Mrs.\nLinde, reading the card, remarks that Krogstad lives very nearby. Nora replies that it\u2019s hopeless, as the letter is already in the box and Torvald keeps the key. Mrs. Linde says that Krogstad must find an excuse to get the letter back unread. She tells Nora to distract Torvald, and quickly exits.\n \nThis is the first time that the nature of Mrs. Linde\u2019s and Krogstad\u2019s relationship begins to be revealed, and Mrs. Linde\u2019s confession that Krogstad would have once done anything for her provides hope and foreshadows their eventual marriage. Meanwhile, Nora continues to retreat into talk of the ball as a symbol of happiness, security in her marriage, and respectability n the eyes of society.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora opens the door to Torvald\u2019s study. Torvald asks if he can return to his own living room again. He is surprised to see that Nora has not undergone some \u201cmarvelous transformation.\u201d Dr. Rank, standing in the doorway, said he also expected this. Nora says she will not show herself off before the ball. She says she has completely forgotten the dance, and that she is useless without Torvald\u2019s help. She asks him to promise to help her, and to devote himself exclusively to her. Torvald promises, calling her a \u201chelpless little thing.\u201d\n \nThe following section of the play is filled with double meaning that Nora seems aware of but that is not intended by Torvald. Much of what he says in reference to the ball\u2014for example, the \u201cmarvelous transformation\u201d\u2014has an additional, different meaning in the context of Nora\u2019s secret. Meanwhile, Nora manipulates him by over- exaggerating her performance of the role of the perfect wife.\n\n     \n \nTorvald stops himself, saying before he forgets he should look to see if he has any letters. Nora desperately asks him not too, but he persists. Nora begins to play the opening bars of the tarantella on the piano. Torvald stops to listen. Nora tells him that she won\u2019t be able to dance the next day if she doesn\u2019t rehearse with Torvald just then because she is so nervous. She asks him to play for her and tell her what to do. Torvald agrees, and Nora grabs a tambourine and drapes a colored shawl around herself. Torvald plays and Nora begins to dance, with Dr. Rank watching. Torvald tells her to slow down and be less wild, but Nora laughs and says this is how it must be. Torvald gets up to better instruct her, swapping with Dr. Rank, who now plays instead. Torvald gives Nora repeated instructions but she doesn\u2019t seem to hear them, only dancing more and more wildly. Her hair even becomes undone but she keeps dancing.\n \nNora disguises her desperation that Torvald not open the letterbox, as well as her generally unhinged disposition, underneath a fa\u00e7ade of stress about her impending performance of the tarantella. In turn, the tarantella is a way of Nora releasing her wild emotions and momentarily casting off her display of composure and respectability in a way that is still considered appropriate by society. We can see her dancing the tarantella as a way of embodying through performance her inner turmoil and desire for freedom.\n\n     \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde enters \u201cas though spellbound.\u201d Nora asks her to see what fun they are having, but Torvald says that Nora is dancing as if her life depended on it. Nora replies that it does, and Torvald tells Dr. Rank to stop playing, causing Nora to come to a sudden stop. Torvald says Nora has forgotten everything he has ever told her. Nora agrees, saying this is why she needs extra practice and instruction, right up until the last minute before the ball. Torvald promises that Nora can rely on him.\n \nNora and Torvald\u2019s comments about Nora dancing as if her life depends on it foreshadows her later statement to Torvald that she did tricks for him in order to live. Torvald\u2019s claim that Nora has forgotten everything he has taught her again has a double meaning, as she has also secretly acted against Torvald\u2019s beliefs about marriage and gender roles.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora urges Torvald not to open any letters, and Torvald says he can tell that there is already a letter from Krogstad in the box, and that that is why Nora is frightened. Nora says there may be, but that Torvald shouldn\u2019t open it because she wouldn\u2019t want anything to come between them before the ball is over. Torvald concedes: \u201cthe child must have her way.\u201d Nora tells him that the next night, after the dance, he will be \u201cfree.\u201d The maid enters and announces that dinner is ready. Nora tells her that they\u2019ll have champagne and asks for lots of macaroons. Torvald takes Nora\u2019s hands and tells her not to be so wild and to be his own singing bird again. Nora ushers Torvald, Dr. Rank and Mrs.\nLinde to go and eat. Dr. Rank murmurs to Torvald if there is anything \u201cimpending,\u201d but Torvald replies that it is only Nora\u2019s childish fears.\n \nEven though there are clearly signs indicating that something more serious is afoot, Torvald ignores them, dismissing Nora\u2019s odd behavior as simply her childish fears. Torvald\u2019s belief that Nora is a child prevents him from really listening to her or understanding the meaning behind her actions. Nora\u2019s request for macaroons shows she is, to a certain extent, unwilling to keep going along with Torvald\u2019s strict rules and desire for her to be like a dependent and obedient child, foreshadowing the final scene of the play when she leaves.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora asks Mrs. Linde what happened when she went out. Mrs. Linde replies that Krogstad has left town, but is coming back the next evening and that she left a note for him. Nora tells her she shouldn\u2019t have done that because things must take their course, but that waiting for the miracle is really a cause for rejoicing. Mrs. Linde asks what she\u2019s waiting for, but Nora says she wouldn\u2019t understand. Mrs. Linde exits to the dining room, leaving Nora a moment alone. Nora counts out the hours until the tarantella and until midnight the next evening, eventually pronouncing: \u201cThirty-one hours to live.\u201d Torvald calls from the doorway for his little skylark, and Nora runs to him.\n \nNora\u2019s behavior here is, again, confusing and contradictory: she seems both unwilling to be what",

What will come next in Act Three is therefore in some ways completely unpredictable; however, her pronunciation that she has \u201cthirty-one hours to live\u201d gives a sense of impending disaster.\n\n     \n \nACT THREE\nThe act opens on the same room, this time only occupied by Mrs. Linde, who is trying to read a book but doesn\u2019t seem able to concentrate. Dance music is heard from the floor above.\nMrs. Linde listens for a sound at the front door, checks her watch, obviously waiting for someone. Eventually, she sees that someone is there, and goes out to let them in. Krogstad enters, saying he found a note from her, and asking what it means. Mrs. Linde explains that she had to talk to him and that it had to be at the Helmers\u2019 house as her house doesn\u2019t have a back entrance. She explains that the Helmers are at the ball, and Krogstad is shocked that they are out dancing.\n \n\n\nMrs. Linde\u2019s behavior in the opening moments of the act build suspense. Her decision to make Krogstad use the back entrance to the Helmers\u2019 house shows that, despite being the play\u2019s biggest advocate for honesty, she is also willing to employ secrecy and deception when she deems it necessary.\n\n   \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde addresses Krogstad by his first name and asks that the two of them talk. Krogstad asks if they have anything to talk about. Mrs. Linde insists that they do; Krogstad disagrees, but Mrs. Linde says that\u2019s because he never understood her.\nKrogstad says there is nothing more to understand of the \u201cold, old story\u201d of a \u201cheartless woman\u201d leaving a man as soon as she gets an offer from someone richer. Mrs. Linde asks if Krogstad truly believes it was easy for her or that she is heartless. She explains that there was nothing else she could do and that she felt bound by duty to break things off with Krogstad. Krogstad angrily remarks that it all happened for money, but Mrs. Linde points out that she had to take care of a helpless mother and two brothers. Krogstad maintains that Mrs. Linde still did not have the right to throw him over for someone else, and Mrs.\nLinde says she\u2019s spent a lot of time wondering if she was justified.\n \nMrs. Linde\u2019s assertion that Krogstad never understood her is significant as this is what Nora also says to Torvald in the final scene of the play; the parallel suggests that perhaps men at the time were unable to understand women. This is backed up by the fact that Krogstad judges Mrs. Linde so harshly for having married someone else. He seems to fail to understand the concept of sacrificing one\u2019s own happiness for the sake of others, something that both women in the play are forced to do.\n\n         \n \n\n \nKrogstad tells Mrs. Linde that when he lost her it felt as if the ground slipped away from under his feet, and that he is now \u201ca broken man clinging to the wreck of my life.\u201d Mrs. Linde says that help might be near, but Krogstad argues that Mrs. Linde has got in the way of help. He tells Mrs. Linde to withdraw from the position at the bank. She says she won\u2019t because it wouldn\u2019t benefit Krogstad if she did. He tells her to do it anyway, but she replies that life has taught her to be cautious.\n \nThis is one of the first times that we see a more human side to Krogstad, The fact that he has led a corrupt and dishonest life because he was heartbroken makes him more likeable as well as more complex. Indeed, one message within the play is that, even when people behave badly, there is often a good reason for behind it.\n\n     \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde points out that both she and Krogstad are struggling alone in bad situations. She laments that she has \u201cnobody to care about, and nobody to care for.\u201d Krogstad says it was Mrs.\nLinde\u2019s own choice, but she insists that she had no choice. She then offers for the two of them to \u201cjoin forces,\u201d as together they would have a better chance than if they were each on their own. She suggests to Krogstad that she came to town because of him. She explains that she has worked all her life and that this has been a source of joy, but without anyone to work for but herself she feels empty. At first, Krogstad resists, saying Mrs.\nLinde is suffering from \u201cwomen\u2019s hysteria\u201d and that she only wants to be \u201cself-sacrificing.\u201d\n \nMrs. Linde clearly finds a genuine sense of joy and purpose in being of service to others, and feels that her life is completely without meaning if she cannot do so. Thus Krogstad is correct in some ways when he accuses her of being self-sacrificing; however, what he fails to understand is that this is what Mrs. Linde truly wants. Mrs. Linde believes selfishness is not good for her; this stands in contrast to Nora\u2019s proclamations at the end of the play that she needs to honor herself as an individual above anyone else.\n\n       \n \nKrogstad, still uncertain, asks if Mrs. Linde knows about his past, and what people think of him. Mrs. Linde replies that Krogstad had just suggested that he would be a different person with her. Krogstad asks Mrs. Linde if she knows what she\u2019s doing and if she has the courage to go through with it. Mrs. Linde tells him that the two of them need each other, that Krogstad\u2019s children need a mother, and that she needs someone to mother. Krogstad takes her hands and thanks her, promising that soon he will have everybody looking up to him.\n \nHere, Mrs. Linde and Krogstad conjure for themselves an unlikely version of the fairytale happy ending. By disregarding society\u2019s judgment of Krogstad and allowing him the opportunity to change, Mrs. Linde ensures that they both have a chance at happiness.\n\n     \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde interrupts Krogstad, saying that she can hear the tarantella. She explains this means the dance is about to end and that he must go. He says he will, but tells her she doesn\u2019t know the things he\u2019s done against the Helmers. Mrs. Linde tells him she does know. He is surprised that she still wants to go through with being with him, but Mrs. Linde explains that she knows what despair does to people. Krogstad regrets that he can\u2019t undo his actions, and Mrs. Linde points out that he can, that the letter is still in the box. Krogstad becomes briefly suspicious that Mrs. Linde\u2019s whole promise to marry him is only to save Nora, but she insists that it isn\u2019t, saying after a person has sold themselves once for other people\u2019s sake, they don\u2019t do it again.\n \nMrs. Linde\u2019s claim that nobody sells themselves twice for other people\u2019s sake is interesting, as it calls into question the idea of duty and self-sacrifice. Although Mrs. Linde does not regret her first marriage as it allowed her to support her family, she has emerged from that experience with the belief that she has the right to her own happiness. This is similar to Nora\u2019s situation; having risked everything to save Torvald\u2019s life, she realizes at the end of the play that she cannot sacrifice her own happiness by continuing to live with him when she doesn\u2019t love him anymore.\n\n     \n \n\n \nKrogstad resolves to ask for his letter back unread, but Mrs. Linde asks him not to. Krogstad, confused, asks if that wasn\u2019t the whole reason Mrs. Linde asked him to come. She says that it was, but having seen what she has seen in the past twenty-four hours she has come to the conclusion that Torvald has to know everything, saying that \u201call this secrecy and deception must end at once.\u201d Krogstad tells Mrs. Linde that he won\u2019t ask for his letter back but says that if there is anything he can do he will do it. Mrs. Linde hears the tarantella ending and tells Krogstad to go. He says he will wait for Mrs. Linde downstairs, and exits saying he has never felt so happy in his life.\n \nHere, Mrs. Linde radically disrupts the course of events in the play. While it would have been easier for her to ask Krogstad to get his letter back, thereby ensuring that life between the Helmers went on as normal, Mrs. Linde\u2019s steadfast belief in honesty triumphs over her promise to Nora. This ultimately benefits Nora, as Torvald\u2019s behavior when he reads the letter allows her to see the reality of her situation and that she no longer wants to remain in her marriage.\n\n     \n \n\n \nMrs. Linde tidies the room and talks to herself about how things can change and how happy she is that she has people to work for and to live for. She gets her coat and hat ready and waits excitedly for the Helmers to return. They enter, Torvald pushing Nora, who is dressed in the Italian costume, \u201calmost forcibly\u201d into the hall. Nora stands in the doorway, saying she wants to stay longer at the ball. She begs Torvald for another hour there, but he refuses, leading her \u201cgently but firmly\u201d into the room.\n \nIn a somewhat ironic twist, Mrs. Linde and Krogstad\u2019s happiness now stands in contrast to what is now shown to be Nora and Torvald\u2019s unhealthy relationship. Torvald\u2019s physical manipulation of Nora shows his disregard for her autonomy and the way he handles her like a doll.\n\n       \n \nMrs. Linde greets them, and both Nora and Torvald are shocked to see her there so late. Mrs. Linde says she was too late to catch them before they went upstairs but says she wanted to see them before leaving. Torvald says that Nora is indeed \u201cworth looking at.\u201d He says that everybody at the party thought she was lovely, but adds that she is stubborn, and that he had to use force to get her to leave. Nora says that Torvald will soon be sorry he didn\u2019t let her stay longer. Torvald recalls the evening, saying Nora danced the tarantella well and was wildly applauded, although the dance was perhaps too realistic. He explains that he then wanted to take Nora immediately after so as not to \u201cspoil the effect,\u201d saying that exits must be dramatic, but that Nora doesn\u2019t understand this.\n \nIn this passage it is clear that Torvald is thinking of Nora far more as a possession that he can flaunt in order to impress other people than a real person with her own thoughts and feelings. To him, Nora was at the party merely to perform for the enjoyment of him and others, not to have a good time herself.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald notices that it is dark and goes in to light candles. While he is out of earshot, Nora asks Mrs. Linde what has happened. Mrs. Linde replies that she has spoken to Krogstad and that Nora has nothing to fear from him, but that Nora must tell Torvald everything. Nora responds: \u201cI knew it\u201d and says she won\u2019t tell Torvald. Mrs. Linde says that then the letter will tell Torvald for her. Nora thanks her and says she now knows what must happen.\n \nNora\u2019s bitter reaction to the fact that Mrs. Linde did not get Krogstad to retrieve the letter shows that she has cut herself off even from her close friends in her obsession with the secret of the debt. All the hope and innocence seems to have drained out of her, and she has become a much more serious, grave person.\n\n   \n \n\n \nTorvald returns and asks if Mrs. Linde has finished admiring Nora. Mrs. Linde says she has and that she must go. Torvald reminds her to take her knitting, and suggests that she should embroider instead, as embroidery is prettier than knitting. Mrs. Linde bids them goodnight and tells Nora to stop being so stubborn. Once she is gone, Torvald remarks that she is \u201ca frightful bore.\u201d\n \nTorvald\u2019s harsh judgment of Mrs. Linde and recommendation that she embroider because it\u2019s \u201cprettier\u201d suggests he thinks women\u2019s value lies in their looks.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora asks Torvald if he is tired, but he says he is extremely lively. Nora admits that she is very tired and wants to go to sleep, and Torvald asks if he wasn\u2019t then right that they shouldn\u2019t have stayed longer. Nora tells him that everything he does is right, but says it without much conviction. Torvald points out that now she is talking common sense again, and asks her if she noticed how happy Dr. Rank seemed. Nora says she didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him.\n \nThis exchange suggests that",

Nora admits that she is very tired and wants to go to sleep, and Torvald asks if he wasn\u2019t then right that they shouldn\u2019t have stayed longer. Nora tells him that everything he does is right, but says it without much conviction. Torvald points out that now she is talking common sense again, and asks her if she noticed how happy Dr. Rank seemed. Nora says she didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him.\n \nThis exchange suggests that Nora is beginning to see the emptiness of her role as a woman who always obeys her husband unquestioningly. Torvald doesn\u2019t seem to notice her increasing disillusionment, showing his obliviousness to her thoughts.\n\n   \n \nTorvald says how happy he is to be alone with Nora. Nora asks that he not look at her \u201clike that,\u201d and Torvald responds by asking if he can\u2019t look at his \u201cmost treasured possession.\u201d He says that he can tell she still has the tarantella in her blood and that makes her even more desirable. He delivers a speech explaining that when they are out at a party together he does not talk to Nora much, instead pretending that they are secretly in love and engaged. He then says that when they leave he pretends that they have just got married and that he is taking Nora to their new home for the first time. He tells her that as he was watching her perform the tarantella his \u201cblood was on fire\u201d and that was why he took her downstairs immediately after. Nora continues to refuse him, telling him to leave her alone. Torvald asks if this is a game Nora is playing, and reminds her that he is her husband.\n \nIn this speech we see that Torvald\u2019s love and desire for Nora relies more on a fantasy than an appreciation for who she truly is as a person. He talks about his sexual desire for her with no consideration of whether she is feeling the same way at the moment; indeed, when she tells him that she doesn\u2019t want to be with him that night, he dismisses her feelings by saying she must be playing a game. In reminding her that he is her husband, Torvald is suggesting that their marriage means Nora does not have the right to refuse sex with him, a commonly held belief at the time.\n\n   \n \n\n \nThere is a knock at the door, and Dr. Rank announces himself. Torvald is annoyed by the intrusion, but greets Dr. Rank in a friendly way. Dr. Rank explains that he heard the sound of their voices and just wanted to stop by. He tells them what a good time he had upstairs and talks about how excellent the wine and champagne were. Nora remarks that Torvald also drank a lot of champagne. Dr. Rank says he was celebrating the best possible results of a laboratory test, saying that he now has \u201ccertainty.\u201d Nora comments that he is fond of masquerades, and asks what she and Torvald should go as next time. Torvald remarks that it is \u201cfrivolous\u201d that Nora is already thinking about the next time, but Dr. Rank responds that she should go as Lady Luck and simply wear her everyday clothes. Nora asks what Dr. Rank will be, and he replies \u201cinvisible.\u201d He asks Torvald for a cigar, lights it, and bids them goodnight. Nora tells him \u201csleep well\u201d and asks that he tell her the same. He does, and exits.\nTorvald remarks that he seemed drunk, and Nora absently agrees.\n \nThe source of Dr. Rank\u2019s joy seems to not only lie in the fact that he is now certain of his impending death but also his newfound ability to indulge in Earthly pleasures such as cigars and alcohol without worry. This is ironic, as he is convinced that his father\u2019s consumption of luxurious food and alcohol was what caused his spinal tuberculosis. Although Dr. Rank drops several quite obvious hints that he is about to die, Torvald and, to a lesser extent, Nora seem fairly oblivious, revealing the extent to which they are too wrapped up in their own lives to truly notice anything around them.\n\n   \n \n\n \nTorvald goes to the letter box and says he must empty it. He notices that somebody has tried to open the lock, and finds one of Nora\u2019s hairpins. She says it must have been the children, and Torvald instructs her to tell them not to play with it. Looking through the mail, he finds two visiting cards from Dr. Rank with black crosses above his name. He remarks that it is as if Dr.\nRank is announcing his death, and Nora replies that he is, explaining that Dr. Rank told her that he would not see them when he died. Nora says she thinks it\u2019s best when that sort of thing happens without words. Torvald, not paying much attention to her, gives a speech about how he can\u2019t imagine Dr. Rank gone, saying that his suffering provided a background that made Torvald and Nora\u2019s happiness even brighter. He says that it may be for the best that Dr. Rank\u2019s suffering will end, for Rank himself and for Nora and Torvald, as it will now be just the two of them.\n \nThe momentary distraction of the appearance of Dr. Rank\u2019s symbolic visiting cards builds suspense for Torvald\u2019s eventual discovery of the letter from Krogstad. Torvald\u2019s reaction to learning that he will never see Dr. Rank again is unfeeling and selfish. His view that Dr. Rank\u2019s suffering made his own life seem even happier suggests that the basis of his happiness is highly superficial and dependent on the idea that he has a better life than others. Torvald\u2019s lack of sadness at Dr. Rank\u2019s death shows that he must not have been a very good friend.\n\n   \n \nTorvald holds Nora and says that he sometimes wishes her life were in danger so that he could risk everything to save her.\nNora tears herself away and tells Torvald to read his letters. At first Torvald says he will leave them until the morning because he just wants to be with Nora that night, but Nora asks if he can do that knowing that Dr. Rank is dying. Torvald concedes that he does feel unsettled and that \u201can ugly thing\u201d has come between them because now they are thinking of death. He resolves that they go to sleep separately and kisses Nora goodnight. She puts her arms around his neck and bids him goodnight too.\n \nTorvald\u2019s supposed desire to risk everything for Nora\u2019s sake is revealed as false at the end of the play when the \u201cmiracle\u201d she was hoping for\u2014that he take the blame for her crime\u2014does not happen. At this point, Nora\u2019s embrace with Torvald before she goes to bed shows that she does have a small lingering affection for him, but we get the sense that this is disappearing fast.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald takes the letters into his study. Nora, wild-eyed, wraps Torvald\u2019s cloak around herself and whispers about never seeing him and the children again. She talks of black icy water and wishes it were all over. She says goodbye out loud to Torvald and her children and goes to leave. However, she is stopped by Torvald pushing open the door of his study.\n \nNora is preparing to kill herself, perhaps the ultimate symbol of self- sacrifice. Her whispering murmurs on the stage suggests that she is descending into madness, and her resemblance to the many other literary heroines who go mad before killing themselves is clear.\n\n       \n \n\n \nTorvald holds up the letter and asks if Nora knows what\u2019s in it. She admits that she does, and asks that he let her go, insisting that he not try to save her. Torvald asks in disbelief if what Krogstad writes is true, and Nora says it is, saying she loved Torvald more than anything in the world. He says this is a \u201cpaltry excuse,\u201d calls her a \u201cmiserable woman\u201d and asks what it is she\u2019s done. Nora tells him again to let her go and not to try and take the blame for her. He tells her to stop play-acting, locks the front door, and says she must stay to give an account of herself.\n \nNora\u2019s repeated insistence that Torvald not take the blame reveals a misguided and, it turns out, overly optimistic belief that he would do that. His reaction to Krogstad\u2019s letter suggests that he has lost all his love and respect for her in an instant, and his totally unforgiving attitude shows the precariousness and superficiality of their relationship.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald paces up and down, saying that in the eight years they have been married, Nora has been \u201ca hypocrite, a liar, worse than that, a criminal!\u201d He says he should have realized something like this would happen because her father had no religion, morals, or sense of duty. He claims that this is his punishment for turning a blind eye to Nora\u2019s father. He says that Nora has ruined his happiness and jeopardized his future, as he is now at the mercy of Krogstad. He says he must now do whatever Krogstad wants, and all because of Nora, who he calls \u201ca feather-brained woman.\u201d\n \nHere is another example of the belief in how parents influence children, with the specific idea that moral corruption is passed from parent to child. The fact that Torvald doesn\u2019t even consider standing up to Krogstad shows that Krogstad was right to suggest that Torvald didn\u2019t have \u201ccourage\u201d and wouldn\u2019t defend Nora.\n\n         \n \n\n \nNora promises Torvald that after she dies, he will be free. Torvald says she is pretending and says it would not do him any good if she died, because Krogstad could still tell other people about Nora\u2019s crime and that people might even suspect Torvald was an accomplice, or that he was behind it. He asks if Nora understands what she has done to him, and adds that it is after he has taken care of her so well all through their marriage. Nora replies coldly that she understands.\n \nTorvald\u2019s reaction to the knowledge that Nora wants to kill herself is harsh and entirely self-centered, suggesting he doesn\u2019t care for Nora at all. Throughout this whole section of the play Torvald only thinks of himself and doesn\u2019t pause to consider the way Nora has been and will be affected by Krogstad\u2019s threats, or that Nora did what she did purely out of love for him.\n\n       \n \nTorvald tells Nora to take her shawl off and begins to talk about what he plans to do next. He says he will try to find a way of appeasing Krogstad, and will make sure that nobody finds out about the whole situation. He tells Nora that things must appear to be the same between them, but that he will not let her raise the children, as he can\u2019t trust her to do so. He insists that they must preserve appearances.\n \nTorvald\u2019s thoughts about preserving appearances reveal that respectability matters more to him than his own happiness, the happiness of others, or love. It also suggests that he believes that, no matter how badly he treats Nora, she will continue to obey him and play along with whatever plan he devises.\n\n       \n \n\n \nThe doorbell rings. Torvald tells Nora to hide, but she doesn\u2019t move. The maid enters and says there is a note for Nora.\nTorvald snatches it and says Nora cannot read it. He announces that it is from Krogstad. He reads it, and cries out that he is saved. Nora asks about herself, and he adds that she is also saved. He reveals that Krogstad has sent Nora\u2019s IOU back, saying his circumstances have improved and that he regrets what he did. Torvald rips up the IOU and throws it in the fire, telling Nora that nobody can do anything to her now. He says that in the note Krogstad has written that Nora knew about the forgery and Krogstad\u2019s threat since Christmas eve, and Torvald says how hard it must have been for her. Nora says that yes, it has been hard.\n \nTorvald\u2019s snatching of the note addressed to Nora shows that he doesn\u2019t believe she has the right to privacy. The fact that his first words after reading it are \u201cI\u2019m saved\u201d is telling; Torvald has only considered this situation in light of his own fate, with Nora barely even existing as an afterthought.\n\n       \n \n\n \nTorvald talks about the \u201cagonies\u201d that Nora must have suffered, but then declares that they should forget all about it. He says they can rejoice because the whole thing is over. He asks Nora why she still looks down, and before she can reply says it must be because she can\u2019t believe Torvald has forgiven her. He tells her that he has forgiven her because he knows that she did what she did because she loved him, and that she simply didn\u2019t have the experience to know what to do. He says that he doesn\u2019t love her any less for that, and that she need only rely on him for guidance. He tells her he wouldn\u2019t really be a man if he didn\u2019t find women more attractive when they are helpless. He tells her to forget about what he said when he first found out about the debt, because now he has forgiven her. Nora thanks him for his forgiveness, and goes to leave.\n \nTorvald\u2019s sudden, more forgiving way of talking to Nora highlights the fact that he understood as soon as he first read the letter from Krogstad that she",

He tells her to forget about what he said when he first found out about the debt, because now he has forgiven her. Nora thanks him for his forgiveness, and goes to leave.\n \nTorvald\u2019s sudden, more forgiving way of talking to Nora highlights the fact that he understood as soon as he first read the letter from Krogstad that she had been forced to borrow the money and couldn\u2019t really be blamed for the consequences. This makes his initial reaction to the situation even more awful. His belief that he is doing her a great kindness in forgiving her\u2014and doing so only after the consequences of forgiving her are no longer dire\u2014conveys how deluded he is. His statement about finding a helpless woman doubly as attractive highlights the warped effect ideas about gender at the time had on marriage and relationships.\n\n         \n \n\n \nTorvald asks Nora where she is going, and she answers that she is going to take off her dress from the dance. He tells her that\u2019s a good idea, and that she should get some rest. He uses imagery of Nora as a hunted dove who he has rescued and will look after, saying that tomorrow she will see things differently and that everything will seem like it once was. He asks her if she really thought he was going to turn her out, saying that that is not what a real man would do. He says that it is a satisfying feeling for a man to know he has forgiven his wife, because it makes her his property in two senses: she is now both his wife and his child. He tells her not to worry about anything, and that he will make all the decision for her.\n \nTorvald, rather than foreseeing that the unfolding events will be the destruction of his marriage, is so deluded that he believes his and Nora\u2019s relationship will emerge even stronger and more to his liking. His comment that Nora is now doubly his property and like a child to him reveals explicitly the extent to which he does not believe she is an autonomous adult, and that treating her like a child and his property is the proper way to behave within a marriage.\n\n     \n \nNora returns, wearing her everyday clothes. Torvald, surprised, asks why she\u2019s not in bed. Nora replies that she won\u2019t sleep that night, and asks Torvald to sit down so they can talk. Torvald says he is frightened and doesn\u2019t understand, and Nora replies that this is exactly her point; he does not understand her. She asks that he doesn\u2019t interrupt and simply listens to her. She asks if it is striking to him that, in their eight years of marriage, this is the first time they have had a serious conversation together. Torvald says it depends what she means by serious, and says he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to got her involved in things that would worry her. Nora, however, replies that she is not talking about things that would worry her.\n \nNora has evidently undergone a transformation both visually and in the way she speaks to Torvald. For the first time, she is addressing him as an equal and demanding that he treat her with respect by listening and not interrupting.\n\n   \n \n\n \nNora explains that Torvald has never understood her and that she has been wronged both by him and her father. Torvald, shocked, asks how that can be true of the two people who loved her more than anyone else. Nora replies that neither of them really loved her, only thought how nice it was to be in love with her. She explains that she felt pressured to think the exact same way as her father. She adds that he played with her as she played with her dolls, and that it is the same now she is married to Torvald. She says she has survived by doing \u201ctricks\u201d for Torvald, and that it is his fault she has never made anything of herself.\n \nNora\u2019s sudden insight into her relationships with Torvald and her father is surprising and cathartic. The fact that she claims to have lived by doing \u201ctricks\u201d for Torvald is certainly backed up by all their talk of her singing, dancing, and otherwise performing for him. To blame Torvald and her father for the fact that she has never become the person she wants to be would have been an extremely radical and shocking claim at the time.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald, infuriated, says that Nora is being ungrateful. He asks if she was happy in their marriage, and Nora replies that she only thought she was happy, but in reality she wasn\u2019t. She explains that, although Torvald has been kind to her, she has only ever been his doll-wife, just as she was her father\u2019s doll- child, saying she found it fun when Torvald came to play with her. Torvald concedes that although Nora is speaking in an \u201cexaggerated and hysterical\u201d way, there is some truth to what she says. He adds that now it will be different, promising that playtime will end and there will now be lessons for both her and the children. Nora tells him that he is not able to teach her how to be a good wife to him, and that she is not able to teach the children, as he pointed out only a moment ago. Torvald tells her to ignore what he said earlier, but she says he was right, and that she must now go about educating herself.\n \nThis is the first time that the metaphor of the doll\u2019s house becomes explicitly clear in the play. Nora\u2019s comments about being a doll-wife suggest that every marriage in which the wife is in some way controlled by the husband is comparable to a doll\u2019s house, a daring assertion at the time. It is significant that Torvald does not disagree with her, but rather agrees and yet sees nothing wrong with the idea of having a doll-wife. This reveals the extent to which such relationships were accepted and even encouraged by society as healthy and normal.\n\n     \n \n\n \nNora reveals to Torvald that she is planning to leave him immediately, and that she will go to stay with Mrs. Linde for the night. Torvald forbids her, but Nora says there\u2019s no use, and that she will take only her personal belongings and nothing of his. She tells him that the next day she will go back to her old home, where it will be easier for her to find something to do.\nTorvald says that this is madness and that Nora is blind and inexperienced. Nora points out that she is trying to get experience.\n \nMrs. Linde and Nora\u2019s childhood home both (at least for now) symbolize the status of being an unmarried woman, an identity that Nora believes will afford her more freedom.\n\n     \n \nTorvald asks if she cares about leaving her husband and children, or what people will say. Nora replies that she has no interest in what people say, and that leaving is necessary for her, with an emphasis on the word \u201cme.\u201d Torvald says that she is betraying her \u201cmost sacred duty\u201d to her husband and children. Nora replies that she has an equally sacred duty to herself.\nTorvald refutes this, saying she is \u201cfirst and foremost a wife and mother.\u201d But Nora says that even though this is what most people think, she no longer believes it, arguing that she is primarily an individual and must think for herself.\n \nFor Torvald, a woman\u2019s duty to her husband and children and her reputation within society are clearly interlinked. Because Nora now has little interest in her reputation, she is able to overcome the idea of a duty to others and focus on herself. Torvald clearly considers women to be wives and mothers before they are even people; it is only after much struggle that Nora is able to refute this belief.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald asks if Nora does not have an infallible guide to the question of her position in the home and in life: her religion. Nora replies that she doesn\u2019t really know what religion is, and intends to figure out her thoughts on the subject when she goes away. Torvald replies that if religion cannot keep Nora \u201con the right path,\u201d then he will try to awaken her moral conscience, if she has one. Nora replies that she doesn\u2019t know, and that it\u2019s not an easy thing to judge. She says she knows that her morals are different from Torvald\u2019s, and also different from the law\u2019s, which she believes must be wrong as it did not preserve her right to protect her husband and father on his deathbed.\nTorvald replies that she is talking like a child and doesn\u2019t understand society. Nora replies that she doesn\u2019t, but wants to learn.\n \nNora\u2019s radically modern view of religion would have been highly scandalous at the time. She also seems to be an advocate of moral relativism, the belief that there are no fixed, objective moral rules but rather that morality means different things to different people. This, along with her criticism of the law, are all sophisticated ideas, but Torvald responds to them by saying she is talking like a child. However, Torvald\u2019s refusal to critically evaluate the rules of society suggests that it is actually he who is na\u00efve and ignorant, not Nora.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald says Nora is ill and delirious. Nora replies that she has never felt so calm and collected, and Torvald says that the only explanation behind what she is doing then must be that she doesn\u2019t love him anymore. Nora confirms that this is true, that she is sorry because he has always been kind to her, but that she can\u2019t help not loving him. She explains that she fell out of love with Torvald when the miracle she was waiting for didn\u2019t happen, and that Torvald is therefore not the man she thought he was. She says that she hoped that when Torvald learned of Krogstad\u2019s demands, he would not give in and tell Krogstad to tell the whole world. She hoped he would then step forward and take the blame for everything. However, Torvald was not willing to sacrifice himself for her.\n \nIn this section, it becomes clear that Nora has an additional reason for leaving Torvald, related but nevertheless distinct from her thoughts on religion, society, and individuality: she no longer loves Torvald. The fact that she has both an emotional and intellectual basis for deciding to leave proves that it is not the rash, insane decision that Torvald is making it out to be, but rather, as Nora claims, a rather rational one. Nora had expected Torvald to \"act like a man\" and offer to protect her even if it ruined him, but in discovering that he would do no such thing she realized that she had misunderstood the entire structure of their marriage. She had thought that there was love beneath the roles, but in fact there were just the roles.\n \nTorvald tells Nora that nobody sacrifices his honor for the person he loves, but Nora replies that thousands of women have done so. Torvald repeats that Nora thinks and talks like \u201ca stupid child.\u201d Nora responds that Torvald thinks like someone she would not want to spend her life with. She points out that once he received the IOU back from Krogstad, he wanted to go on pretending that nothing had happened, except to protect Nora even more because he had realized how weak she supposedly was. She says that this made her realize she had been married to a stranger. She says she cannot bear to even think about it, and that the thought makes her want to tear herself to shreds.\n \nNora and Torvald\u2019s exchange about honor and love is interesting: it highlights a disparity between the genders in that men were expected to put their reputation first, whereas women were often forced to disregard their own honor for the sake of others. Nora\u2019s comment that she is married to a \u201cstranger\u201d show the extent to which her view of the world as changed; her old life is unfamiliar and even repulsive to her.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald acknowledges sadly that there is a \u201ctremendous gulf\u201d between them, and asks if there is any way to bridge it. He even promises to change, but Nora says the only way that would be possible were if his \u201cdoll\u201d were to be taken away. Torvald says he cannot imagine being separated from her, and Nora replies that this is why she must go. She gets her things ready, and Torvald begs her to at least wait until the morning. She insists that she can\u2019t spend the night in a strange man\u2019s room. He asks that they stay living together \u201cas brother and sister,\u201d but Nora says it couldn\u2019t last. She bids him goodbye and says she doesn\u2019t want to see the children, knowing they are in better hands.\n \nThis is a turning point in Torvald\u2019s attitude to Nora. While at first he\u2014perhaps convinced that she would not really go\u2014called her actions insane and childish, he is now taking what she says seriously and even offering to change for her. This suggests that there is a part of Torvald that does perhaps truly love Nora. Nora\u2019s cold attitude towards both him and the children, which would have been considered outrageous at the time, reveals the intensity of her convictions, and that Torvald himself isn't the sole problem\u2014the institution of marriage itself is.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald asks if some day things might change. Nora says she cannot know what she will be in the future, and Torvald says she will always be his wife. Nora points out that when a wife leaves her husband, he is absolved of responsibility of her, and that",

Nora says she cannot know what she will be in the future, and Torvald says she will always be his wife. Nora points out that when a wife leaves her husband, he is absolved of responsibility of her, and that this is necessary for both of them to feel free. She gives him her wedding ring, and asks for his. Nora says the maids know the house better than she does, and that Mrs. Linde will come the next day to have Nora\u2019s belongings packed and shipped. Torvald asks if Nora will think of him, and Nora replies that she reckons she will think of him and her children often. He asks if he can write to her but she refuses. He asks if he can offer to help her, but Nora replies that she does not accept help from strangers.\n \nHere Nora conducts what can be considered an unofficial divorce ceremony. Although Torvald doesn\u2019t want her to go, the fact that he agrees to give her his ring and not to write or try to help her shows that he finally respects her wishes and ability to make decisions for herself. Nora\u2019s comment that the maids know the house better than she does suggests that the role of wives of Nora\u2019s social class was something of a fa\u00e7ade, and that this is perhaps one of the reasons why she feels she has to escape her marriage.\n\n     \n \n\n \nTorvald asks if there is any way that he could one day be more than a stranger to Nora. Nora replies only by \u201ca miracle of miracles,\u201d if both of them would change. Torvald seems hopeful, but Nora says she no longer believes in miracles. Torvald says he does believe, and asks how he must change. Nora said he would have to change to a point where they could make their marriage work. She bids him goodbye and exits. Torvald sinks to a chair with his face in his hands and cries out Nora\u2019s name. He looks around at the room and exclaims that it is empty. He looks up with sudden hope, saying: \u201cthe miracle of miracles?\u201d The play ends with the sound of the door slamming shut.\n \nThe final moments of the play deal with the theme of the destruction of hope. Nora\u2019s capacity for hope has already been destroyed, as shown by the fact that she says she no longer believes in miracles. Meanwhile, the devastated Torvald has one final moment of hope at the very end of the play; however, the decisive slam of the door brings this moment to an abrupt end, finally shattering the illusion of his and Nora\u2019s marriage.\n",

At the back, a door to the right leads to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer\u2019s study. Between the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left- hand wall is a door, and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, armchairs and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small bookcase with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove.\nIt is winter. A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]\nNORA: Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. [To the PORTER, taking out her purse.] How much?\nPORTER: Sixpence.\nNORA: There is a shilling. No, keep the change. [The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband\u2019s door and listens.] Yes, he is in. [Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]\nHELMER: [Calls out from the study.] Is that my little lark twittering out there?\n\nNORA: [Busy opening some of the parcels.] Yes, it is! HELMER: Is it my little squirrel bustling about? NORA: Yes!\nHELMER: When did my squirrel come home?\nNORA: Just now. [Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.] Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.\nHELMER: Don\u2019t disturb me. [A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.]Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?\nNORA: Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to pinch and scrape.\nHELMER: Still, you know, we can\u2019t spend money recklessly.\nNORA: Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn\u2019t we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money.\nHELMER: Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due.\nNORA: Pooh! We can borrow until then.\nHELMER: Nora! [Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.] The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year\u2019s Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and\u2014\nNORA: [Putting her hands over his mouth.] Oh! don\u2019t say such horrid things. HELMER: Still, suppose that happened,\u2014what then?\nNORA: If that were to happen, I don\u2019t suppose I should care whether I owed\n\nmoney or not.\nHELMER: Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?\nNORA: They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.\nHELMER: That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle.\nNORA: [Moving towards the stove.] As you please, Torvald.\nHELMER: [Following her.] Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? [Taking out his purse.] Nora, what do you think I have got here?\nNORA: [Turning round quickly.] Money!\nHELMER: There you are. [Gives her some money.] Do you think I don\u2019t know\nwhat a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?\nNORA: [Counting.] Ten shillings\u2014a pound\u2014two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.\nHELMER: Indeed it must.\nNORA: Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly\u2019s bedstead for Emmy,\u2014they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.\nHELMER: And what is in this parcel?\nNORA: [Crying out.] No, no! You mustn\u2019t see that until this evening.\n\nHELMER: Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself?\nNORA: For myself? Oh, I am sure I don\u2019t want anything.\nHELMER: Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would\nparticularly like to have.\nNORA: No, I really can\u2019t think of anything\u2014unless, Torvald\u2014\nHELMER: Well?\nNORA: [Playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his.] If you really want to give me something, you might\u2014you might\u2014\nHELMER: Well, out with it!\nNORA: [Speaking quickly.] You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as\nmuch as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it. HELMER: But, Nora\u2014\nNORA: Oh, do! Dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas tree. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun?\nHELMER: What are little people called that are always wasting money?\nNORA: Spendthrifts\u2014I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn\u2019t it?\nHELMER: [Smiling.] Indeed it is\u2014that is to say, if you were really to save all of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.\nNORA: Oh but, Torvald\u2014\nHELMER: You can\u2019t deny it, my dear little Nora. [Puts his arm round her\n\nwaist.] It\u2019s a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!\nNORA: It\u2019s a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.\nHELMER: [Laughing.] That\u2019s very true,\u2014all you can. But you can\u2019t save\nanything!\nNORA: [Smiling quietly and happily.] You haven\u2019t any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.\nHELMER: You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.\nNORA: Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa\u2019s qualities.\nHELMER: And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking rather\u2014 what shall I say\u2014rather uneasy today?\nNORA: Do I?\nHELMER: You do, really. Look straight at me.\nNORA: [Looks at him.] Well?\nHELMER: [Wagging his finger at her.] Hasn\u2019t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in town today?\nNORA: No; what makes you think that?\nHELMER: Hasn\u2019t she paid a visit to the confectioner\u2019s? NORA: No, I assure you, Torvald\u2014\nHELMER: Not been nibbling sweets?\n\nNORA: No, certainly not.\nHELMER: Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?\nNORA: No, Torvald, I assure you really\u2014\nHELMER: There, there, of course I was only joking.\nNORA: [Going to the table on the right.] I should not think of going against your wishes.\nHELMER: No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word\u2014 [Going up to her.] Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas tree is lit, no doubt.\nNORA: Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?\nHELMER: No. But there is no need; it is assumed he will dine with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can\u2019t think how I am looking forward to this evening.\nNORA: So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!\nHELMER: It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a\nbig enough income. It\u2019s delightful to think of, isn\u2019t it?\nNORA: It\u2019s wonderful!\nHELMER: Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent!\nNORA: I didn\u2019t find it dull.\nHELMER: [Smiling.] But there was precious little result, Nora.\nNORA: Oh, you shouldn\u2019t tease me about that again. How could I help the cat\u2019s going in and tearing everything to pieces?\n\nHELMER: Of course you couldn\u2019t, poor little girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that\u2019s the main thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.\nNORA: Yes, it is really wonderful.\nHELMER: This time I needn\u2019t sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn\u2019t ruin\nyour dear eyes and your pretty little hands\u2014\nNORA: [Clapping her hands.] No, Torvald, I needn\u2019t any longer, need I! It\u2019s wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! [Taking his arm.] Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over\u2014 [A bell rings in the hall.] There\u2019s the bell. [She tidies the room a little.] There\u2019s someone at the door. What a nuisance!\nHELMER: If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.\nMAID: [In the doorway.] A lady to see you, ma\u2019am,\u2014a stranger.\nNORA: Ask her to come in.\nMAID: [To HELMER] The doctor came at the same time, sir.\nHELMER: Did he go straight into my room?\nMAID: Yes, sir.\n[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in MRS LINDE, who is in travelling dress, and shuts the door.]\nMRS LINDE: [In a dejected and timid voice.] How do you do, Nora? NORA: [Doubtfully.] How do you do\u2014\nMRS LINDE: You don\u2019t recognise me, I suppose.\nNORA: No, I don\u2019t know\u2014yes, to be sure, I seem to\u2014 [Suddenly.] Yes! Christine! Is it really you?\n\nMRS LINDE: Yes, it is I.\nNORA: Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could I\u2014 [In\na gentle voice.] How you have altered, Christine!\nMRS LINDE: Yes, I have indeed. In nine ... ten long years\u2014\nNORA: Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter\u2014that was plucky of you.\nMRS LINDE: I arrived by steamer this morning.\nNORA: To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold, I hope. [Helps her.] Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy. No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. [Takes her hands.] Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first moment\u2014You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.\nMRS LINDE: And much, much older, Nora.\nNORA: Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.

My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.\nMRS LINDE: What do you mean, Nora?\nNORA: [Gently.] Poor Christine, you are a widow. MRS LINDE: Yes; it is three years ago now.\nNORA: Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me.\nMRS LINDE: I quite understand, dear.\n\nNORA: It was very bad of me, Christine.

You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of commissions. For the future we can live quite differently\u2014we can do just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy,\n\nChristine! It will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won\u2019t it?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what one needs. NORA: No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.\nMRS LINDE: [Smiling.] Nora, Nora, haven\u2019t you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.\nNORA: [Laughing.] Yes, that is what Torvald says now. [Wags her finger at her.] But \u201cNora, Nora\u201d is not so silly as you think. We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.\nMRS LINDE: You too?\nNORA: Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. [Dropping her voice.] And other things as well. You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before. But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he couldn\u2019t stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south.\nMRS LINDE: You spent a whole year in Italy, didn\u2019t you?\nNORA: Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald\u2019s life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.\nMRS LINDE: So I should think.\nNORA: It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That\u2019s a lot, isn\u2019t it? MRS LINDE: Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the money. NORA: I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.\n\nMRS LINDE: Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn\u2019t it?\nNORA: Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn\u2019t go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar\u2019s birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father\u2014I never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.\nMRS LINDE: I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to Italy? NORA: Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our going,\nso we started a month later.\nMRS LINDE: And your husband came back quite well?\nNORA: As sound as a bell!\nMRS LINDE: But\u2014the doctor?\nNORA: What doctor?\nMRS LINDE: I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as I did, was the doctor?\nNORA: Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn\u2019t come here professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour\u2019s illness since then, and our children are strong and healthy and so am I. [Jumps up and claps her hands.] Christine! Christine! It\u2019s good to be alive and happy!\u2014But how horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. [Sits on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.] You mustn\u2019t be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband? Why did you marry him?\nMRS LINDE: My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.\nNORA: No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?\n\nMRS LINDE: I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was nothing left.\nNORA: And then\u2014?\nMRS LINDE: Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find\u2014first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for themselves.\nNORA: What a relief you must feel if\u2014\nMRS LINDE: No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. [Gets up restlessly.] That was why I could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work\u2014office work of some kind\u2014\nNORA: But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.\nMRS LINDE: [Walking to the window.] I have no father to give me money for a journey, Nora.\nNORA: [Rising.] Oh, don\u2019t be angry with me!\nMRS LINDE: [Going up to her.] It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have taken\u2014you will hardly believe it\u2014I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.\nNORA: How do you mean?\u2014Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.\n\nMRS LINDE: Yes, that was what I was thinking of.\nNORA: He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very cleverly\u2014I will think of something that will please him very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.\nMRS LINDE: How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind of you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life.\nNORA: I\u2014? I know so little of them?\nMRS LINDE: [Smiling.] My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!\u2014\nYou are a child, Nora.\nNORA: [Tosses her head and crosses the stage.] You ought not to be so superior.\nMRS LINDE: No?\nNORA: You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable of anything serious\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Come, come\u2014\nNORA:\u2014that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.\nMRS LINDE: But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.\nNORA: Pooh!\u2014Those were trifles. [Lowering her voice.] I have not told you the important thing.\nMRS LINDE: The important thing? What do you mean?\nNORA: You look down upon me altogether, Christine\u2014but you ought not to. You\nare proud, aren\u2019t you, of having worked so hard and so long for your mother?\nMRS LINDE: Indeed, I don\u2019t look down on anyone. But it is true that I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of my mother\u2019s life almost free from care.\n\nNORA: And you are proud to think of what you have done for your brothers? MRS LINDE: I think I have the right to be.\nNORA: I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to be proud and glad of.\nMRS LINDE: I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?\nNORA: Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn\u2019t on any account\u2014\nno one in the world must know, Christine, except you.\nMRS LINDE: But what is it?\nNORA: Come here. [Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.] Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who saved Torvald\u2019s life.\nMRS LINDE: \u201cSaved\u201d? How?\nNORA: I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have recovered if\nhe had not gone there\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.\nNORA: [Smiling.] Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but\u2014\nMRS LINDE: But\u2014\nNORA: Papa didn\u2019t give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.\nMRS LINDE: You? All that large sum?\nNORA: Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?\nMRS LINDE: But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the Lottery?\nNORA: [Contemptuously.] In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in\n\nthat.\nMRS LINDE: But where did you get it from, then?\nNORA: [Humming and smiling with an air of mystery.] Hm, hm! Aha!\nMRS LINDE: Because you couldn\u2019t have borrowed it.\nNORA: Couldn\u2019t I? Why not?\nMRS LINDE: No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband\u2019s consent.\nNORA: [Tossing her head.] Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for business\u2014a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever\u2014\nMRS LINDE: I don\u2019t understand it at all, Nora.\nNORA: There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the money. I may have got it some other way. [Lies back on the sofa.] Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am\u2014\nMRS LINDE: You are a mad creature.\nNORA: Now, you know you\u2019re full of curiosity, Christine.\nMRS LINDE: Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven\u2019t you been a little bit imprudent? NORA: [Sits up straight.] Is it imprudent to save your husband\u2019s life?\nMRS LINDE: It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to\u2014\nNORA: But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My goodness, can\u2019t you understand that? It was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn\u2019t try, first of all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even\n\nhinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry, Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my husband not to",

That nearly made him angry, Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices\u2014as I believe he called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved\u2014and that was how I came to devise a way out of the difficulty\u2014\nMRS LINDE: And did your husband never get to know from your father that the money had not come from him?\nNORA: No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then\u2014alas, there never was any need to tell him.\nMRS LINDE: And since then have you never told your secret to your husband?\nNORA: Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.\nMRS LINDE: Do you mean never to tell him about it?\nNORA: [Meditatively, and with a half smile.] Yes\u2014someday, perhaps, after many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don\u2019t laugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve\u2014 [Breaking off.] What nonsense! That time will never come. Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for Torvald must have a good table. I couldn\u2019t let\n\nmy children be shabbily dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet little darlings!\nMRS LINDE: So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life, poor Nora?\nNORA: Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me, Christine\u2014because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn\u2019t it?\nMRS LINDE: Quite so.\nNORA: Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.\nMRS LINDE: How much have you been able to pay off in that way?\nNORA: I can\u2019t tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits\u2019 end. [Smiles.] Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me\u2014\nMRS LINDE: What! Who was it?\nNORA: Be quiet!\u2014that he had died; and that when his will was opened it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: \u201cThe lovely Mrs Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash.\u201d\nMRS LINDE: But, my dear Nora\u2014who could the man be?\nNORA: Good gracious, can\u2019t you understand? There was no old gentleman at all;\n\nit was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I couldn\u2019t think of any way of procuring money. But it\u2019s all the same now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am concerned; I don\u2019t care about him or his will either, for I am free from care now. [Jumps up.] My goodness, it\u2019s delightful to think of, Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip\u2014perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it\u2019s a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. [A bell is heard in the hall.]\nMRS LINDE: [Rising.] There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.\nNORA: No, don\u2019t go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for Torvald.\nSERVANT: [At the hall door.] Excuse me, ma\u2019am\u2014there is a gentleman to see the master, and as the doctor is with him\u2014\nNORA: Who is it?\nKROGSTAD: [At the door.] It is I, Mrs Helmer. [MRS LINDE starts, trembles, and\nturns to the window.]\nNORA: [Takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice.] You?\nWhat is it? What do you want to see my husband about?\nKROGSTAD: Bank business\u2014in a way. I have a small post in the bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now\u2014\nNORA: Then it is\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs Helmer; absolutely nothing\nelse.\nNORA: Be so good as to go into the study, then. [She bows indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the fire in the stove.]\n\nMRS LINDE: Nora\u2014who was that man?\nNORA: A lawyer, by the name of Krogstad.\nMRS LINDE: Then it really was he.\nNORA: Do you know the man?\nMRS LINDE: I used to\u2014many years ago. At one time he was a solicitor\u2019s clerk in our town.\nNORA: Yes, he was.\nMRS LINDE: He is greatly altered.\nNORA: He made a very unhappy marriage.\nMRS LINDE: He is a widower now, isn\u2019t he?\nNORA: With several children. There now, it is burning up. [Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.]\nMRS LINDE: They say he carries on various kinds of business.\nNORA: Really! Perhaps he does; I don\u2019t know anything about it. But don\u2019t let us\nthink of business; it is so tiresome.\nDOCTOR RANK: [Comes out of HELMER\u2019S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to him.] No, my dear fellow, I won\u2019t disturb you; I would rather go in to your wife for a little while. [Shuts the door and sees MRS LINDE.] I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you two.\nNORA: No, not at all. [Introducing him.] Doctor Rank, Mrs Linde.\nRANK: I have often heard Mrs Linde\u2019s name mentioned here. I think I passed you\non the stairs when I arrived, Mrs Linde?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, I go up very slowly; I can\u2019t manage stairs well.\n\nRANK: Ah! Some slight internal weakness?\nMRS LINDE: No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.\nRANK: Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?\nMRS LINDE: I have come to look for work.\nRANK: Is that a good cure for overwork?\nMRS LINDE: One must live, Doctor Rank.\nRANK: Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary. NORA: Look here, Doctor Rank\u2014you know you want to live.\nRANK: Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at this very moment with Helmer\u2014\nMRS LINDE: [Sadly.] Ah!\nNORA: Whom do you mean?\nRANK: A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don\u2019t know at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs Helmer; but even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live.\nNORA: Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?\nRANK: I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the bank.\nNORA: I didn\u2019t know this\u2014what\u2019s his name\u2014Krogstad had anything to do with the bank.\nRANK: Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. [To MRS LINDE.] I don\u2019t know whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption, and, as soon as they\n\nhave found some, put the person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.\nMRS LINDE: Still I think the sick are those who most need taking care of.\nRANK: [Shrugging his shoulders.] Yes, there you are. That is the sentiment that is\nturning Society into a sick-house.\n[NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands.]\nRANK: Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society really is?\nNORA: What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the people who are employed in the bank dependent on Torvald now?\nRANK: Is that what you find so extremely amusing?\nNORA: [Smiling and humming.] That\u2019s my affair! [Walking about the room.] It\u2019s perfectly glorious to think that we have\u2014that Torvald has so much power over so many people. [Takes the packet from her pocket.] Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?\nRANK: What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here. NORA: Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.\nMRS LINDE: What! I\u2014?\nNORA: Oh, well, don\u2019t be alarmed! You couldn\u2019t know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!\u2014once in a way\u2014That\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! [Puts a macaroon into his mouth.] You must have one too, Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one\u2014or at most two. [Walking about.] I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.\nRANK: Well, what is that?\n\nNORA: It\u2019s something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could hear me. RANK: Well, why can\u2019t you say it?\nNORA: No, I daren\u2019t; it\u2019s so shocking.\nMRS LINDE: Shocking?\nRANK: Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might. What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?\nNORA: I should just love to say\u2014Well, I\u2019m damned! RANK: Are you mad?\nMRS LINDE: Nora, dear\u2014!\nRANK: Say it, here he is!\nNORA: [Hiding the packet.] Hush! Hush! Hush! [HELMER comes out of his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.]\nNORA: Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?\nHELMER: Yes, he has just gone.\nNORA: Let me introduce you\u2014this is Christine, who has come to town. HELMER: Christine\u2014? Excuse me, but I don\u2019t know\u2014\nNORA: Mrs Linde, dear; Christine Linde.\nHELMER: Of course. A school friend of my wife\u2019s, I presume?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, we have known each other since then.\nNORA: And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see you. HELMER: What do you mean?\nMRS LINDE: No, really, I\u2014\n\nNORA: Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect herself\u2014\nHELMER: Very sensible, Mrs Linde.\nNORA: And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the bank\u2014the news was telegraphed, you know\u2014she travelled here as quick as she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for Christine, for my sake, won\u2019t you?\nHELMER: Well, it is not altogether impossible.

Aren\u2019t they darlings?\nRANK: Don\u2019t let us stand here in the draught.\nHELMER: Come along, Mrs Linde; the place will only be bearable for a mother\nnow!\n[RANK, HELMER, and MRS LINDE go downstairs. The NURSE comes forward with THE CHILDREN; NORA shuts the hall door.]\nNORA: How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks like apples and roses. [THE CHILDREN all talk at once while she speaks to them.] Have you had great fun? That\u2019s splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob along on the sledge?\u2014 both at once?\u2014that was good. You are a clever boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby doll! [Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and down.] Yes, yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snowballing? I wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne; please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen. There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.\n[The NURSE goes into the room on the left. NORA takes off the children\u2019s things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at once.]\n\nNORA: Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn\u2019t bite you? No, dogs don\u2019t bite nice little dolly children. You mustn\u2019t look at the parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No, no\u2014it\u2019s something nasty! Come, let us have a game! What shall we play at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we\u2019ll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first. Must I hide? Very well, I\u2019ll hide first. [She and the children laugh and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last NORA hides under the table, the children rush in and out for her, but do not see her; they hear her smothered laughter, run to the table, lift up the cloth and find her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends to frighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at the hall door, but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened, and KROGSTAD appears, he waits a little; the game goes on.]\nKROGSTAD: Excuse me, Mrs Helmer.\nNORA: [With a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees.] Ah! What do\nyou want?\nKROGSTAD: Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot to shut it.\nNORA: [Rising.] My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad. KROGSTAD: I know that.\nNORA: What do you want here, then?\nKROGSTAD: A word with you.\nNORA: With me?\u2014[To the children, gently.] Go in to nurse. What? No, the strange man won\u2019t do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have another game. [She takes the children into the room on the left, and shuts the door after them.] You want to speak to me?\nKROGSTAD: Yes, I do.\nNORA: Today? It is not the first of the month yet.\n\nKROGSTAD: No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what sort of a Christmas you will spend.\nNORA: What do you mean? Today it is absolutely impossible for me\u2014 KROGSTAD: We won\u2019t talk about that until later on. This is something different. I\npresume you can give me a moment? NORA: Yes\u2014yes, I can\u2014although\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Good. I was in Olsen\u2019s Restaurant and saw your husband going down the street\u2014\nNORA: Yes?\nKROGSTAD: With a lady.\nNORA: What then?\nKROGSTAD: May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs Linde? NORA: It was.\nKROGSTAD: Just arrived in town?\nNORA: Yes, today.\nKROGSTAD: She is a great friend of yours, isn\u2019t she?\nNORA: She is. But I don\u2019t see\u2014\nKROGSTAD: I knew her too, once upon a time.\nNORA: I am aware of that.\nKROGSTAD: Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I can ask you, without beating about the bush\u2014is Mrs Linde to have an appointment in the bank?\nNORA: What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?\u2014You, one of my\n\nhusband\u2019s subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause, Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.\nKROGSTAD: I was right in what I thought, then.\nNORA: [Walking up and down the stage.] Sometimes one has a tiny little bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not necessarily follow that\u2014. When anyone is in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone who\u2014who\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Who has influence? NORA: Exactly.\nKROGSTAD: [Changing his tone.] Mrs Helmer, you will be so good as to use your influence on my behalf.\nNORA: What? What do you mean?\nKROGSTAD: You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my\nsubordinate position in the bank.\nNORA: What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away from you?\nKROGSTAD: Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.\nNORA: But I assure you\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when I\nshould advise you to use your influence to prevent that. NORA: But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence.\n\nKROGSTAD: Haven\u2019t you? I thought you said yourself just now\u2014\nNORA: Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I! What should\nmake you think I have any influence of that kind with my husband?\nKROGSTAD: Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don\u2019t suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.\nNORA: If you speak slightingly of my husband, I shall turn you out of the house. KROGSTAD: You are bold, Mrs Helmer.\nNORA: I am not afraid of you any longer. As soon as the New Year comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.\nKROGSTAD: [Controlling himself.] Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. If necessary, I am prepared to fight for my small post in the bank as if I were fighting for my life.\nNORA: So it seems.\nKROGSTAD: It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that weighs least with me in the matter. There is another reason\u2014well, I may as well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.\nNORA: I think I have heard something of the kind.\nKROGSTAD: The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I had to do something; and, honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been one of the worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in the town. This post in the bank was like the first step up for me\u2014and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.\nNORA: But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to help you at all.\n\nKROGSTAD: Then it is because you haven\u2019t the will; but I have means to compel you.\nNORA: You don\u2019t mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you money?\nKROGSTAD: Hm!\u2014suppose I were to tell him?\nNORA: It would be perfectly infamous of you. [Sobbing.] To think of his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly, clumsy way\u2014that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a horribly disagreeable position\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Only disagreeable?\nNORA: [Impetuously.] Well, do it, then!\u2014and it will be the worse for you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you certainly won\u2019t keep your post then.\nKROGSTAD: I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that you were afraid of?\nNORA: If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once pay you what is still owed, and we shall have nothing more to do with you.\nKROGSTAD: [Coming a step nearer.] Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. Either you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be obliged to remind you of a few details.\nNORA: What do you mean?\nKROGSTAD: When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two hundred\nand fifty pounds.\nNORA: I didn\u2019t know anyone else to go to. KROGSTAD: I promised to get you that amount\u2014 NORA: Yes, and you did so.\n\nKROGSTAD: I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions. Your mind was so taken up with your husband\u2019s illness, and you were so anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the security of a bond which I drew up.\nNORA: Yes, and which I signed.\nKROGSTAD: Good. But below your signature there were a few lines constituting\nyour father a surety for the money; those lines your father should have signed. NORA: Should? He did sign them.\nKROGSTAD: I had left the date blank; that is to say, your father should himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you remember that?\nNORA: Yes, I think I remember\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is that not\nso?\nNORA: Yes.\nKROGSTAD: And you naturally did so at once, because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your father\u2019s signature. And then I gave you the money.\nNORA: Well, haven\u2019t I been paying it off regularly?\nKROGSTAD: Fairly so, yes. But\u2014to come back to the matter in hand\u2014that must\nhave been a very trying time for you, Mrs Helmer? NORA: It was, indeed.\nKROGSTAD: Your father was very ill, wasn\u2019t he? NORA: He was very near his end.\nKROGSTAD: And died soon afterwards?\n\nNORA: Yes.\nKROGSTAD: Tell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day\nyour father died?\u2014on what day of the month, I mean.\nNORA: Papa died on the 29th of September.\nKROGSTAD: That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so, there is a discrepancy [taking a paper from his pocket] which I cannot account for.\nNORA: What discrepancy? I don\u2019t know\u2014\nKROGSTAD: The",

NORA: He was very near his end.\nKROGSTAD: And died soon afterwards?\n\nNORA: Yes.\nKROGSTAD: Tell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day\nyour father died?\u2014on what day of the month, I mean.\nNORA: Papa died on the 29th of September.\nKROGSTAD: That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so, there is a discrepancy [taking a paper from his pocket] which I cannot account for.\nNORA: What discrepancy? I don\u2019t know\u2014\nKROGSTAD: The discrepancy consists, Mrs Helmer, in the fact that your father\nsigned this bond three days after his death.\nNORA: What do you mean? I don\u2019t understand\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look here; your father has dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a discrepancy, isn\u2019t it? [NORA is silent.] Can you explain it to me? [NORA is still silent.] It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words \u201c2nd of October,\u201d as well as the year, are not written in your father\u2019s handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death. There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name; and that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs Helmer? It was your father himself who signed his name here?\nNORA: [After a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him.] No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa\u2019s name.\nKROGSTAD: Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?\nNORA: In what way? You shall have your money soon.\nKROGSTAD: Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to your\n\nfather?\nNORA: It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn\u2019t tell him that my husband\u2019s life was in danger\u2014it was impossible.\nKROGSTAD: It would have been better for you if you had given up your trip abroad.\nNORA: No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband\u2019s life; I couldn\u2019t give that up.\nKROGSTAD: But did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud on me?\nNORA: I couldn\u2019t take that into account; I didn\u2019t trouble myself about you at all. I couldn\u2019t bear you, because you put so many heartless difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my husband was in.\nKROGSTAD: Mrs Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse than what you have done.\nNORA: You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife\u2019s life?\nKROGSTAD: The law cares nothing about motives. NORA: Then it must be a very foolish law.\nKROGSTAD: Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if I produce this paper in court.\nNORA: I don\u2019t believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her husband\u2019s life? I don\u2019t know much about law; but I am certain that there must be laws permitting such\n\nthings as that. Have you no knowledge of such laws\u2014you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.\nKROGSTAD: Maybe. But matters of business\u2014such business as you and I have had together\u2014do you think I don\u2019t understand that? Very well. Do as you please. But let me tell you this\u2014if I lose my position a second time, you shall lose yours with me. [He bows, and goes out through the hall.]\nNORA: [Appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her head.] Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!\u2014I am not so silly as he thinks. [Begins to busy herself putting the children\u2019s things in order.] And yet \u2014? No, it\u2019s impossible! I did it for love\u2019s sake.\nTHE CHILDREN: [In the doorway on the left.] Mother, the stranger man has gone out through the gate.\nNORA: Yes, dears, I know. But, don\u2019t tell anyone about the stranger man. Do you hear? Not even papa.\nCHILDREN: No, mother; but will you come and play again? NORA: No, no,\u2014not now.\nCHILDREN: But, mother, you promised us.\nNORA: Yes, but I can\u2019t now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run away in, my sweet little darlings. [She gets them into the room by degrees and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops.] No! [Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out.] Helen! bring the tree in. [Goes to the table on the left, opens a drawer, and stops again.] No, no! It is quite impossible!\nMAID: [Coming in with the tree]. Where shall I put it, ma\u2019am? NORA: Here, in the middle of the floor.\nMAID: Shall I get you anything else?\n\nNORA: No, thank you. I have all I want. [Exit MAID.]\nNORA: [Begins dressing the tree.] A candle here-and flowers here\u2014The horrible man! It\u2019s all nonsense\u2014there\u2019s nothing wrong. The tree shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you, Torvald!\u2014I will sing for you, dance for you\u2014[HELMER comes in with some papers under his arm.] Oh! Are you back already?\nHELMER: Yes. Has anyone been here?\nNORA: Here? No.\nHELMER: That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.\nNORA: Did you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad was here for a moment.\nHELMER: Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging you to say a good word for him.\nNORA: Yes.\nHELMER: And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were to\nconceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn\u2019t he beg that of you too?\nNORA: Yes, Torvald, but\u2014\nHELMER: Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise? And to tell me a lie into the bargain?\nNORA: A lie\u2014?\nHELMER: Didn\u2019t you tell me no one had been here? [Shakes his finger at her.] My little songbird must never do that again. A songbird must have a clean beak to chirp with\u2014no false notes! [Puts his arm round her waist.] That is so, isn\u2019t it? Yes, I am sure it is. [Lets her go.] We will say no more about it. [Sits down by the stove.] How warm and snug it is here! [Turns over his papers.]\n\nNORA: [After a short pause, during which she busies herself with the Christmas tree.] Torvald!\nHELMER: Yes.\nNORA: I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy-dress ball at the\nStenborgs\u2019 the day after tomorrow.\nHELMER: And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to surprise me with.\nNORA: It was very silly of me to want to do that. HELMER: What do you mean?\nNORA: I can\u2019t hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of seems so silly and insignificant.\nHELMER: Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?\nNORA: [Standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it.] Are you very\nbusy, Torvald?\nHELMER: Well\u2014\nNORA: What are all those papers? HELMER: Bank business.\nNORA: Already?\nHELMER: I have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work; and I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have everything in order for the New Year.\nNORA: Then that was why this poor Krogstad\u2014 HELMER: Hm!\n\nNORA: [Leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair.] If you hadn\u2019t been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour, Torvald.\nHELMER: What is that? Tell me.\nNORA: There is no one that has such good taste as you. And I do so want to look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn\u2019t you take me in hand and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?\nHELMER: Aha! So my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to come to her rescue?\nNORA: Yes, Torvald, I can\u2019t get along a bit without your help.\nHELMER: Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon something.\nNORA: That is nice of you. [Goes to the Christmas tree. A short pause.] How pretty the red flowers look\u2014. But, tell me, was it really something very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?\nHELMER: He forged someone\u2019s name. Have you any idea what that means? NORA: Isn\u2019t it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?\nHELMER: Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that kind.\nNORA: No, you wouldn\u2019t, would you, Torvald?\nHELMER: Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has openly\nconfessed his fault and taken his punishment. NORA: Punishment\u2014?\nHELMER: But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.\nNORA: But do you think it would\u2014?\n\nHELMER: Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And about the children\u2014 that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.\nNORA: How?\nHELMER: Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of the germs of evil.\nNORA: [Coming nearer him.] Are you sure of that?\nHELMER: My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother.\nNORA: Why do you only say\u2014mother?\nHELMER: It seems most commonly to be the mother\u2019s influence, though naturally a bad father\u2019s would have the same result. Every lawyer is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I say he has lost all moral character. [Holds out his hands to her.] That is why my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give me your hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There now, that\u2019s settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company of such people.\nNORA: [Takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the Christmas tree.] How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.\nHELMER: [Getting up and putting his papers in order.] Yes, and I must try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must think about your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in gold paper to hang up on the tree. [Puts his hand on her head.] My precious little singing-bird! [He\n\ngoes into his room and shuts the door after him.]\nNORA: [After a pause, whispers.] No, no\u2014it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s impossible; it must be\nimpossible.\n[The NURSE opens the door on the left.]\nNURSE: The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma. NORA: No, no, no! Don\u2019t let them come in to me! You stay with them, Anne. NURSE: Very well, ma\u2019am. [Shuts the door.]\nNORA: [Pale with terror.] Deprave my little children? Poison my home? [A short pause. Then she tosses her head.] It\u2019s not true. It can\u2019t possibly be true.\n\nACT II\n[THE SAME SCENE\u2014The Christmas tree is in the corner by the piano, stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches.

How are the children?\nNURSE: The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but\u2014 NORA: Do they ask much for me?\n\nNURSE: You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.\nNORA: Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I was\nbefore.\nNURSE: Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.\nNORA: Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she went away altogether?\nNURSE: Good heavens!\u2014went away altogether?\nNORA: Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about\u2014\nhow could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers? NURSE: I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora\u2019s nurse.\nNORA: Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?\nNURSE: What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked man didn\u2019t do a single thing for me.\nNORA: But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.\nNURSE: No, indeed she hasn\u2019t. She wrote to me when she was confirmed, and\nwhen she was married.\nNORA: [Putting her arms round her neck.] Dear old Anne, you were a good mother to me when I was little.\nNURSE: Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.\nNORA: And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you would\u2014What nonsense I am talking! [Opens the box.] Go in to them. Now I must\u2014. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.\nNURSE: I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you, ma\u2019am. [Goes into the room on the left.]\n\nNORA: [Begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her.] If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No one will come. Only I mustn\u2019t think about it. I will brush my muff. What lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two, three, four, five, six \u2014[Screams.] Ah! there is someone coming\u2014. [Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.]\n[Enter MRS LINDE from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and hat.]\nNORA: Oh, it\u2019s you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there? How good of you to come!\nMRS LINDE: I heard you were up asking for me.\nNORA: Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs\u2019, who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.\nMRS LINDE: I see; you are going to keep up the character.\nNORA: Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it made\nfor me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven\u2019t any idea\u2014\nMRS LINDE: We will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that\u2019s all we want.\nNORA: It is nice of you.\nMRS LINDE: [Sewing.] So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what\u2014I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.\nNORA: [Gets up, and crosses the stage.] Well, I don\u2019t think yesterday was as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier, Christine.\n\nCertainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty and attractive.\nMRS LINDE: And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father\u2019s daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as he was yesterday?\nNORA: No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you understand?\nMRS LINDE: [Dropping her sewing.] But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything about such things?\nNORA: [Walking about.] Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits now and then from\u2014from married women, who know something of medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another.\nMRS LINDE: [Goes on sewing. A short silence.] Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?\nNORA: Everyday regularly. He is Torvald\u2019s most intimate friend, and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.\nMRS LINDE: But tell me this\u2014is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn\u2019t he the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?\nNORA: Not in the least. What makes you think that?\nMRS LINDE: When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I noticed that your husband hadn\u2019t the slightest idea who I was. So how could Doctor Rank\u2014?\nNORA: That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.\n\nMRS LINDE: Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many things, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more experience. Let me tell you this\u2014you ought to make an end of it with Doctor Rank.\nNORA: What ought I to make an end of?\nMRS LINDE: Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a\nrich admirer who was to leave you money\u2014\nNORA: An admirer who doesn\u2019t exist, unfortunately! But what then?\nMRS LINDE: Is Doctor Rank a man of means?\nNORA: Yes, he is.\nMRS LINDE: And has no one to provide for?\nNORA: No, no one; but\u2014\nMRS LINDE: And comes here everyday?\nNORA: Yes, I told you so.\nMRS LINDE: But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?\nNORA: I don\u2019t understand you at all.\nMRS LINDE: Don\u2019t prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don\u2019t guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?\nNORA: Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly painful position that would be?\nMRS LINDE: Then it really isn\u2019t he?\nNORA: No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money afterwards.\n\nMRS LINDE: Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.\nNORA: No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank. Although\nI am quite sure that if I had asked him\u2014 MRS LINDE: But of course you won\u2019t.\nNORA: Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Behind your husband\u2019s back?\nNORA: I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be behind his\nback too. I must make an end of it with him.\nMRS LINDE: Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but\u2014\nNORA: [Walking up and down.] A man can put a thing like that straight much easier than a woman\u2014\nMRS LINDE: One\u2019s husband, yes.\nNORA: Nonsense! [Standing still.] When you pay off a debt you get your bond\nback, don\u2019t you?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, as a matter of course.\nNORA: And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it up\u2014the nasty dirty paper!\nMRS LINDE: [Looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly]. Nora, you are concealing something from me.\nNORA: Do I look as if I were?\nMRS LINDE: Something has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora, what\nis it?\nNORA: [Going nearer to her.] Christine! [Listens.] Hush! There\u2019s Torvald come\n\nhome. Do you mind going in to the children for the present? Torvald can\u2019t bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.\nMRS LINDE: [Gathering some of the things together.] Certainly\u2014but I am not going away from here until we have had it out with one another. [She goes into the room on the left, as HELMER comes in from the hall.]\nNORA: [Going up to HELMER.] I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear. HELMER: Was that the dressmaker?\nNORA: No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order. You will see I shall look quite smart.\nHELMER: Wasn\u2019t that a happy thought of mine, now?\nNORA: Splendid! But don\u2019t you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you wish?\nHELMER: Nice?\u2014because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I expect.\nNORA: I suppose you are going to work.\nHELMER: Yes. [Shows her a bundle of papers.] Look at that. I have just been into\nthe bank. [Turns to go into his room.]\nNORA: Torvald.\nHELMER: Yes.\nNORA: If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily\u2014? HELMER: What then?\nNORA: Would you do it?\nHELMER: I should like to hear what it is, first.\n\nNORA: Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would be nice, and do what she wants.\nHELMER: Speak plainly.\nNORA: Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising and\nfalling\u2014\nHELMER: Well, my skylark does that anyhow.\nNORA: I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight, Torvald.\nHELMER: Nora\u2014you surely don\u2019t mean that request you made to me this morning?\nNORA: [Going near him.] Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly\u2014 HELMER: Have you really the courage to open up that question again?\nNORA: Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank.\nHELMER: My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs Linde shall have. NORA: Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as well\ndismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.\nHELMER: This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected to\u2014\nNORA: That isn\u2019t the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened to death of him\u2014\nHELMER: Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare you. NORA: What do you mean?\nHELMER: Naturally you are thinking of your father.\n\nNORA: Yes\u2014yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not been so kindly disposed",

Just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.\nHELMER: My little Nora, there is an important difference between your father and me. Your father\u2019s reputation as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long as I hold my office.\nNORA: You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no cares\u2014 you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly\u2014\nHELMER: And it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife\u2019s bidding\u2014\nNORA: And what if it did?\nHELMER: Of course!\u2014If only this obstinate little person can get her way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can tell you! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible for me to have Krogstad in the bank as long as I am manager.\nNORA: Whatever is that?\nHELMER: His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary\u2014 NORA: Yes, you could\u2014couldn\u2019t you?\nHELMER: And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on very intimate terms\n\nwith one another. But this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and every minute it is \u201cI say, Helmer, old fellow!\u201d and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position in the bank intolerable.\nNORA: Torvald, I don\u2019t believe you mean that.\nHELMER: Don\u2019t you? Why not?\nNORA: Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.\nHELMER: What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow- minded?\nNORA: No, just the opposite, dear\u2014and it is exactly for that reason.\nHELMER: It\u2019s the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well\u2014I must put an end to this. [Goes to the hall door and calls.] Helen!\nNORA: What are you going to do?\nHELMER: [Looking among his papers.] Settle it. [Enter MAID.] Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and here is the money.\nMAID: Very well, sir. [Exit with the letter.]\nHELMER: [Putting his papers together.] Now then, little Miss Obstinate. NORA: [Breathlessly.] Torvald\u2014what was that letter?\nHELMER: Krogstad\u2019s dismissal.\nNORA: Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her back! Do it for my sake\u2014for your own sake\u2014for the children\u2019s sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don\u2019t know what that letter can bring upon us.\n\nHELMER: It\u2019s too late.\nNORA: Yes, it\u2019s too late.\nHELMER: My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn\u2019t it an insult to think that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver\u2019s vengeance? But I forgive you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great love for me. [Takes her in his arms.] And that is as it should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to take everything upon myself.\nNORA: [In a horror-stricken voice.] What do you mean by that? HELMER: Everything, I say\u2014\nNORA: [Recovering herself.] You will never have to do that.\nHELMER: That\u2019s right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife should. That is how it shall be. [Caressing her.] Are you content now? There! There!\u2014not these frightened dove\u2019s eyes! The whole thing is only the wildest fancy!\u2014Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you please. [Turns back at the door.] And when Rank comes, tell him where he will find me. [Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his room, and shuts the door after him.]\nNORA: [Bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and whispers.] He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in spite of everything.\u2014 No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than that! Oh, for some help, some way out of it! [The door-bell rings.] Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that\u2014 anything, whatever it is! [She puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the following dialogue it begins to grow dark.]\nNORA: Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn\u2019t go in to\n\nTorvald now; I think he is busy with something. RANK: And you?\nNORA: [Brings him in and shuts the door after him.] Oh, you know very well I always have time for you.\nRANK: Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.\nNORA: What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?\nRANK: Well, does that alarm you?\nNORA: It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?\nRANK: Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn\u2019t expect it to happen so soon.\nNORA: [Gripping him by the arm.] What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me.\nRANK: [Sitting down by the stove.] It is all up with me. And it can\u2019t be helped.\nNORA: [With a sigh of relief.] Is it about yourself?\nRANK: Who else? It is no use lying to one\u2019s self. I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.\nNORA: What an ugly thing to say!\nRANK: The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer\u2019s refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won\u2019t have him in my sick-room.\n\nNORA: Oh, but, Doctor Rank\u2014\nRANK: I won\u2019t have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun.\nNORA: You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a really good humour.\nRANK: With death stalking beside me?\u2014To have to pay this penalty for another man\u2019s sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted\u2014\nNORA: [Putting her hands over her ears.] Rubbish! Do talk of something cheerful.\nRANK: Oh, it\u2019s a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent spine has to suffer for my father\u2019s youthful amusements.\nNORA: [Sitting at the table on the left.] I suppose you mean that he was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don\u2019t you?\nRANK: Yes, and to truffles.\nNORA: Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?\nRANK: Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.\nNORA: And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice things should take their revenge on our bones.\nRANK: Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.\nNORA: Yes, that\u2019s the saddest part of it all.\nRANK: [With a searching look at her.] Hm!\u2014 NORA: [After a short pause.] Why did you smile?\n\nRANK: No, it was you that laughed.\nNORA: No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!\nRANK: [Rising.] You are a greater rascal than I thought.\nNORA: I am in a silly mood today.\nRANK: So it seems.\nNORA: [Putting her hands on his shoulders.] Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death mustn\u2019t take you away from Torvald and me.\nRANK: It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone are soon forgotten.\nNORA: [Looking at him anxiously.] Do you believe that?\nRANK: People form new ties, and then\u2014\nNORA: Who will form new ties?\nRANK: Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs Linde want here last night?\nNORA: Oho!\u2014you don\u2019t mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?\nRANK: Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am done for,\nthis woman will\u2014\nNORA: Hush! Don\u2019t speak so loud. She is in that room. RANK: Today again. There, you see.\nNORA: She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how unreasonable you are! [Sits down on the sofa.] Be nice now, Doctor Rank, and tomorrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can imagine I am doing it all for you\u2014and for Torvald too, of course. [Takes various things out of the box.] Doctor Rank, come and sit down here, and I will show you something.\n\nRANK: [Sitting down.] What is it? NORA: Just look at those!\nRANK: Silk stockings.\nNORA: Flesh-coloured. Aren\u2019t they lovely? It is so dark here now, but tomorrow \u2014. No, no, no! You must only look at the feet. Oh well, you may have leave to look at the legs too.\nRANK: Hm!\u2014\nNORA: Why are you looking so critical? Don\u2019t you think they will fit me?\nRANK: I have no means of forming an opinion about that.\nNORA: [Looks at him for a moment.] For shame! [Hits him lightly on the ear with the stockings.] That\u2019s to punish you. [Folds them up again.]\nRANK: And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?\nNORA: Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. [She looks among the\nthings, humming to herself.]\nRANK: [After a short silence.] When I am sitting here, talking to you as intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become of me if I had never come into this house.\nNORA: [Smiling.] I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.\nRANK: [In a lower voice, looking straight in front of him.] And to be obliged to\nleave it all\u2014\nNORA: Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.\nRANK: [As before.] And not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of one\u2019s gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret\u2014nothing but an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.\n\nNORA: And if I asked you now for a\u2014? No! RANK: For what?\nNORA: For a big proof of your friendship\u2014 RANK: Yes, yes!\nNORA: I mean a tremendously big favour\u2014\nRANK: Would you really make me so happy for once?\nNORA: Ah, but you don\u2019t know what it is yet.\nRANK: No\u2014but tell me.\nNORA: I really can\u2019t, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour\u2014\nRANK: The bigger a thing it is the better. I can\u2019t conceive what it is you mean. Do tell me. Haven\u2019t I your confidence?\nNORA: More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something you must help me to prevent. You know how",

And now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no one else.\n\nNORA: [Rises, deliberately and quietly.] Let me pass.\nRANK: [Makes room for her to pass him, but sits still.] Nora!\nNORA: [At the hall door.] Helen, bring in the lamp. [Goes over to the stove.] Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.\nRANK: To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?\nNORA: No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need\u2014\nRANK: What do you mean? Did you know\u2014? [MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the table, and goes out.] Nora\u2014Mrs Helmer\u2014tell me, had you any idea of this?\nNORA: Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn\u2019t? I really can\u2019t tell you\u2014To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting on so nicely.\nRANK: Well, at all events you know now that you can command me, body and soul. So won\u2019t you speak out?\nNORA: [Looking at him.] After what happened?\nRANK: I beg you to let me know what it is.\nNORA: I can\u2019t tell you anything now.\nRANK: Yes, yes. You mustn\u2019t punish me in that way. Let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do.\nNORA: You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don\u2019t need any help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is so \u2014of course it is! [Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him with a smile.] You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!\u2014Don\u2019t you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?\nRANK: Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go\u2014for ever?\n\nNORA: No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can\u2019t do without you.\nRANK: Yes, but you?\nNORA: Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.\nRANK: It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a riddle to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my company as in Helmer\u2019s.\nNORA: Yes\u2014you see there are some people one loves best, and others whom one would almost always rather have as companions.\nRANK: Yes, there is something in that.\nNORA: When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids\u2019 room, because they never moralised at all, and talked to each other about such entertaining things.\nRANK: I see\u2014it is their place I have taken.\nNORA: [Jumping up and going to him.] Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never meant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald is a little like being with papa\u2014 [Enter MAID from the hall.]\nMAID: If you please, ma\u2019am. [Whispers and hands her a card.]\nNORA: [Glancing at the card.] Oh! [Puts it in her pocket.]\nRANK: Is there anything wrong?\nNORA: No, no, not in the least. It is only something\u2014it is my new dress\u2014 RANK: What? Your dress is lying there.\nNORA: Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn\u2019t know about it\u2014\n\nRANK: Oho! Then that was the great secret.\nNORA: Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room. Keep him as\nlong as\u2014\nRANK: Make your mind easy; I won\u2019t let him escape.\n[Goes into HELMER\u2019S room.]\nNORA: [To the MAID.] And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?\nMAID: Yes; he came up the back stairs.\nNORA: But didn\u2019t you tell him no one was in?\nMAID: Yes, but it was no good.\nNORA: He won\u2019t go away?\nMAID: No; he says he won\u2019t until he has seen you, ma\u2019am.\nNORA: Well, let him come in\u2014but quietly. Helen, you mustn\u2019t say anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for my husband.\nMAID: Yes, ma\u2019am, I quite understand. [Exit.]\nNORA: This dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of me! No, no, no, it can\u2019t happen\u2014it shan\u2019t happen! [She bolts the door of HELMER\u2019S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.]\nNORA: [Advancing towards him.] Speak low\u2014my husband is at home. KROGSTAD: No matter about that.\nNORA: What do you want of me?\nKROGSTAD: An explanation of something.\nNORA: Make haste then. What is it?\n\nKROGSTAD: You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.\nNORA: I couldn\u2019t prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could on your\nside, but it was no good.\nKROGSTAD: Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I can expose you to, and yet he ventures\u2014\nNORA: How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?\nKROGSTAD: I didn\u2019t suppose so at all. It would not be the least like our dear\nTorvald Helmer to show so much courage\u2014\nNORA: Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.\nKROGSTAD: Certainly\u2014all the respect he deserves. But since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea, than you had yesterday, of what it actually is that you have done?\nNORA: More than you could ever teach me. KROGSTAD: Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am. NORA: What is it you want of me?\nKROGSTAD: Only to see how you were, Mrs Helmer. I have been thinking about you all day long. A mere cashier, a quill-driver, a\u2014well, a man like me\u2014even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.\nNORA: Show it, then; think of my little children.\nKROGSTAD: Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my part.\nNORA: No, of course not; I was sure of that.\nKROGSTAD: The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret between us three.\n\nNORA: My husband must never get to know anything about it.\nKROGSTAD: How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that you can\npay the balance that is owing? NORA: No, not just at present.\nKROGSTAD: Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money soon?\nNORA: No expedient that I mean to make use of.\nKROGSTAD: Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now. If you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never part with your bond.\nNORA: Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.\nKROGSTAD: I shall only preserve it\u2014keep it in my possession. No one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it. So that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution\u2014\nNORA: It has.\nKROGSTAD: If you had it in your mind to run away from your home\u2014\nNORA: I had.\nKROGSTAD: Or even something worse\u2014\nNORA: How could you know that?\nKROGSTAD: Give up the idea.\nNORA: How did you know I had thought of that?\nKROGSTAD: Most of us think of that at first. I did, too\u2014but I hadn\u2019t the courage. NORA: [Faintly.] No more had I.\n\nKROGSTAD: [In a tone of relief.] No, that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it\u2014you hadn\u2019t the courage either?\nNORA: No, I haven\u2019t\u2014I haven\u2019t.\nKROGSTAD: Besides, it would have been a great piece of folly. Once the first\nstorm at home is over\u2014. I have a letter for your husband in my pocket.\nNORA: Telling him everything?\nKROGSTAD: In as lenient a manner as I possibly could.\nNORA: [Quickly.] He mustn\u2019t get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some means of getting money.\nKROGSTAD: Excuse me, Mrs Helmer, but I think I told you just now\u2014\nNORA: I am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you are asking\nmy husband for, and I will get the money.\nKROGSTAD: I am not asking your husband for a penny. NORA: What do you want, then?\nKROGSTAD: I will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs Helmer; I want to get on; and in that your husband must help me. For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable, amid all that time I have been struggling in most restricted circumstances. I was content to work my way up step by step. Now I am turned out, and I am not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again. I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the bank again, in a higher position. Your husband must make a place for me\u2014\nNORA: That he will never do!\nKROGSTAD: He will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon as I am in there again with him, then you will see! Within a year I shall be the manager\u2019s right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer who manages the bank.\n\nNORA: That\u2019s a thing you will never see!\nKROGSTAD: Do you mean that you will\u2014?\nNORA: I have courage enough for it now.\nKROGSTAD: Oh, you can\u2019t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you\u2014 NORA: You will see, you will see.\nKROGSTAD: Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible and unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out\u2014\nNORA: You can\u2019t frighten me.\nKROGSTAD: Nor you me. People don\u2019t do such things, Mrs Helmer. Besides,\nwhat use would it be? I should have him completely in my power all the same.\nNORA: Afterwards? When I am no longer\u2014\nKROGSTAD: Have you forgotten that it is I who have the keeping of your reputation? [NORA stands speechlessly looking at him.] Well, now, I have warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my letter, I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember that it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again. I will never forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs Helmer. [Exit through the hall.]\nNORA: [Goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.] He is going. He is not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! That\u2019s impossible! [Opens the door by degrees.] What is that? He is standing outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he\u2014? [A letter drops into the box; then KROGSTAD\u2019S footsteps are heard, until they die away as he goes downstairs. NORA utters a stifled cry, and runs across the room to the table by the sofa. A short pause.]\nNORA: In the letter-box. [Steals across to the hall door.] There it lies\u2014Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!\n\n[MRS LINDE comes in from the room on the left, carrying the dress.]\nMRS LINDE: There, I can\u2019t see anything more to mend now. Would you like to try it on\u2014?\nNORA: [In a hoarse whisper.] Christine, come here.\nMRS LINDE: [Throwing the dress down on the sofa.] What is the matter with you?\nYou look so agitated!\nNORA: Come here. Do you see that letter? There, look\u2014you can see it through the glass in the letter-box.\nMRS LINDE: Yes, I see it.\nNORA: That letter is from Krogstad.\nMRS LINDE: Nora\u2014it was Krogstad who lent you the money!\nNORA: Yes, and",

I forged a name.\nMRS LINDE: Good heavens\u2014!\nNORA: I only want to say this to you, Christine\u2014you must be my witness.\nMRS LINDE: Your witness? What do you mean? What am I to\u2014?\nNORA: If I should go out of my mind\u2014and it might easily happen\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Nora!\nNORA: Or if anything else should happen to me\u2014anything, for instance, that might prevent my being here\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Nora! Nora! You are quite out of your mind.\n\nNORA: And if it should happen that there were someone who wanted to take all the responsibility, all the blame, you understand\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Yes, yes\u2014but how can you suppose\u2014?\nNORA: Then you must be my witness, that it is not true, Christine. I am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now, and I tell you no one else has known anything about it; I, and I alone, did the whole thing. Remember that.\nMRS LINDE: I will, indeed. But I don\u2019t understand all this.\nNORA: How should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to happen!\nMRS LINDE: A wonderful thing?\nNORA: Yes, a wonderful thing!\u2014But it is so terrible, Christine; it mustn\u2019t happen, not for all the world.\nMRS LINDE: I will go at once and see Krogstad.\nNORA: Don\u2019t go to him; he will do you some harm.\nMRS LINDE: There was a time when he would gladly do anything for my sake.\nNORA: He?\nMRS LINDE: Where does he live?\nNORA: How should I know\u2014? Yes [feeling in her pocket] here is his card. But the letter, the letter\u2014!\nHELMER: [Calls from his room, knocking at the door.] Nora! Nora [Cries out anxiously]. Oh, what\u2019s that? What do you want?\nHELMER: Don\u2019t be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked the door. Are you trying on your dress?\nNORA: Yes, that\u2019s it. I look so nice, Torvald.\n\nMRS LINDE: [Who has read the card.] I see he lives at the corner here.\nNORA: Yes, but it\u2019s no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there in the box.\nMRS LINDE: And your husband keeps the key?\nNORA: Yes, always.\nMRS LINDE: Krogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must find some pretence\u2014\nNORA: But it is just at this time that Torvald generally\u2014\nMRS LINDE: You must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I will come back\nas soon as I can. [She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.]\nNORA: [Goes to HELMER\u2019S door, opens it and peeps in.] Torvald!\nHELMER: [From the inner room.] Well? May I venture at last to come into my own room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see\u2014 [Halting in the doorway.] But what is this?\nNORA: What is what, dear?\nHELMER: Rank led me to expect a splendid transformation.\nRANK: [In the doorway.] I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.\nNORA: Yes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my dress until tomorrow.\nHELMER: But, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been practising too much?\nNORA: No, I have not practised at all.\nHELMER: But you will need to\u2014\nNORA: Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can\u2019t get on a bit without you to help\n\nme; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.\nHELMER: Oh, we will soon work it up again.\nNORA: Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so nervous about it\u2014 all the people\u2014. You must give yourself up to me entirely this evening. Not the tiniest bit of business\u2014you mustn\u2019t even take a pen in your hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?\nHELMER: I promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely at your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of all I will just\u2014 [Goes towards the hall door.]\nNORA: What are you going to do there? HELMER: Only see if any letters have come. NORA: No, no! Don\u2019t do that, Torvald! HELMER: Why not?\nNORA: Torvald, please don\u2019t. There is nothing there.\nHELMER: Well, let me look. [Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the piano,\nplays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the doorway.] Aha! NORA: I can\u2019t dance tomorrow if I don\u2019t practise with you.\nHELMER: [Going up to her.] Are you really so afraid of it, dear?\nNORA: Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.\nHELMER: With great pleasure, if you wish me to. [Sits down at the piano.]\nNORA: [Takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She hastily drapes the shawl around her. Then she springs to the front of the stage and calls out.] Now play for me! I am going to dance!\n\n[HELMER plays and NORA dances. RANK stands by the piano behind HELMER, and looks on.]\nHELMER: [As he plays.] Slower, slower! NORA: I can\u2019t do it any other way. HELMER: Not so violently, Nora!\nNORA: This is the way.\nHELMER: [Stops playing.] No, no\u2014that is not a bit right.\nNORA: [Laughing and swinging the tambourine.] Didn\u2019t I tell you so? RANK: Let me play for her.\nHELMER: [Getting up.] Yes, do. I can correct her better then.\n[RANK sits down at the piano and plays. NORA dances more and more wildly. HELMER has taken up a position beside the stove, and during her dance gives her frequent instructions. She does not seem to hear him; her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders; she pays no attention to it, but goes on dancing. Enter MRS LINDE.]\nMRS LINDE: [Standing as if spell-bound in the doorway.] Oh!\u2014\nNORA: [As she dances.] Such fun, Christine!\nHELMER: My dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life depended on it. NORA: So it does.\nHELMER: Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! [RANK stops playing, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.] I could never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught you.\nNORA: [Throwing away the tambourine.] There, you see.\n\nHELMER: You will want a lot of coaching.\nNORA: Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last\nminute. Promise me that, Torvald! HELMER: You can depend on me.\nNORA: You must not think of anything but me, either today or tomorrow; you mustn\u2019t open a single letter\u2014not even open the letter-box\u2014\nHELMER: Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow\u2014 NORA: Yes, indeed I am.\nHELMER: Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him lying there.\nNORA: I don\u2019t know; I think there is; but you must not read anything of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us until this is all over.\nRANK: [Whispers to HELMER.] You mustn\u2019t contradict her.\nHELMER: [Taking her in his arms.] The child shall have her way. But tomorrow\nnight, after you have danced\u2014\nNORA: Then you will be free. [The MAID appears in the doorway to the right.]\nMAID: Dinner is served, ma\u2019am.\nNORA: We will have champagne, Helen.\nMAID: Very good, ma\u2019am. [Exit.]\nHELMER: Hullo!\u2014are we going to have a banquet?\nNORA: Yes, a champagne banquet until the small hours. [Calls out.] And a few macaroons, Helen\u2014lots, just for once!\nHELMER: Come, come, don\u2019t be so wild and nervous. Be my own little skylark,\n\nas you used.\nNORA: Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and you too, Doctor Rank. Christine, you must help me to do up my hair.\nRANK: [Whispers to HELMER as they go out.] I suppose there is nothing\u2014she is not expecting anything?\nHELMER: Far from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness I was telling you of. [They go into the right-hand room.]\nNORA: Well!\nMRS LINDE: Gone out of town.\nNORA: I could tell from your face.\nMRS LINDE: He is coming home tomorrow evening. I wrote a note for him.\nNORA: You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing. After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.\nMRS LINDE: What is it that you are waiting for?\nNORA: Oh, you wouldn\u2019t understand. Go in to them, I will come in a moment. [MRS LINDE goes into the dining-room. NORA stands still for a little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at her watch.] Five o\u2019clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.\nHELMER: [From the doorway on the right.] Where\u2019s my little skylark? NORA: [Going to him with her arms outstretched.] Here she is!\n\nACT III\n[THE SAME SCENE\u2014The table has been placed in the middle of the stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above. MRS LINDE is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door.]\nMRS LINDE: [Looking at her watch.] Not yet\u2014and the time is nearly up. If only he does not\u2014. [Listens again.] Ah, there he is. [Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.] Come in. There is no one here.\nKROGSTAD: [In the doorway.] I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?\nMRS LINDE: It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.\nKROGSTAD: Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?\nMRS LINDE: It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.\nKROGSTAD: [Coming into the room.] Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight? MRS LINDE: Yes, why not?\nKROGSTAD: Certainly\u2014why not?\nMRS LINDE: Now, Nils, let us have a talk.\nKROGSTAD: Can we two have anything to talk about? MRS LINDE: We have a great deal to talk about.\n\nKROGSTAD: I shouldn\u2019t have thought so.\nMRS LINDE: No, you have never properly understood me.\nKROGSTAD: Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world\u2014a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?\nMRS LINDE: Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?\nKROGSTAD: Didn\u2019t you?\nMRS LINDE: Nils, did you really think that?\nKROGSTAD: If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?\nMRS LINDE: I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.\nKROGSTAD: [Wringing his hands.] So that was it. And all this\u2014only for the sake of money!\nMRS LINDE: You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn\u2019t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed hopeless then.\nKROGSTAD: That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else\u2019s sake.\nMRS LINDE: Indeed I don\u2019t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to do",

We couldn\u2019t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed hopeless then.\nKROGSTAD: That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else\u2019s sake.\nMRS LINDE: Indeed I don\u2019t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to do it.\nKROGSTAD: [More gently.] When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground went from under my feet. Look at me now\u2014I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage.\nMRS LINDE: But help may be near.\nKROGSTAD: It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.\n\nMRS LINDE: Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your place I was going to take in the bank.\nKROGSTAD: I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?\nMRS LINDE: No, because that would not benefit you in the least. KROGSTAD: Oh, benefit, benefit\u2014I would have done it whether or no.\nMRS LINDE: I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.\nKROGSTAD: And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.\nMRS LINDE: Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But deeds you\nmust believe in?\nKROGSTAD: What do you mean by that?\nMRS LINDE: You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.\nKROGSTAD: I had good reason to say so.\nMRS LINDE: Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage\u2014\nno one to mourn for, no one to care for.\nKROGSTAD: It was your own choice.\nMRS LINDE: There was no other choice\u2014then.\nKROGSTAD: Well, what now?\nMRS LINDE: Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces?\nKROGSTAD: What are you saying?\n\nMRS LINDE: Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own.\nKROGSTAD: Christine, I ...\nMRS LINDE: What do you suppose brought me to town? KROGSTAD: Do you mean that you gave me a thought?\nMRS LINDE: I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world\u2014my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working for one\u2019s self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.\nKROGSTAD: I don\u2019t trust that. It is nothing but a woman\u2019s overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.\nMRS LINDE: Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?\nKROGSTAD: Could you really do it? Tell me\u2014do you know all about my past\nlife?\nMRS LINDE: Yes.\nKROGSTAD: And do you know what they think of me here?\nMRS LINDE: You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been quite another man.\nKROGSTAD: I am certain of it. MRS LINDE: Is it too late now?\nKROGSTAD: Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then\u2014?\nMRS LINDE: I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real character\u2014I can dare\n\nanything together with you.\nKROGSTAD: [Grasps her hands.] Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot\u2014\nMRS LINDE: [Listening.] Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go! KROGSTAD: Why? What is it?\nMRS LINDE: Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect them back.\nKROGSTAD: Yes, yes\u2014I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.\nMRS LINDE: Yes, I know all about that.\nKROGSTAD: And in spite of that have you the courage to\u2014?\nMRS LINDE: I understand very well to what lengths a man like you might be driven by despair.\nKROGSTAD: If I could only undo what I have done!\nMRS LINDE: You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.\nKROGSTAD: Are you sure of that?\nMRS LINDE: Quite sure, but\u2014\nKROGSTAD: [With a searching look at her.] Is that what it all means?\u2014That you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?\nMRS LINDE: Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another\u2019s sake, doesn\u2019t do it a second time.\nKROGSTAD: I will ask for my letter back. MRS LINDE: No, no.\n\nKROGSTAD: Yes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter back\u2014that it only concerns my dismissal\u2014that he is not to read it\u2014\nMRS LINDE: No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.\nKROGSTAD: But, tell me, wasn\u2019t it for that very purpose that you asked me to\nmeet you here?\nMRS LINDE: In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret must be disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them, which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.\nKROGSTAD: Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.\nMRS LINDE: [Listening.] You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment longer.\nKROGSTAD: I will wait for you below.\nMRS LINDE: Yes, do. You must see me back to my door ...\nKROGSTAD: I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life! [Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and the hall remains open.]\nMRS LINDE: [Tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready.] What a difference! What a difference! Someone to work for and live for\u2014a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they would be quick and come \u2014[Listens.] Ah, there they are now. I must put on my things. [Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER\u2019S and NORA\u2019S voices are heard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black shawl around her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is flying open.]\n\nNORA: [Hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him.] No, no, no!\u2014 don\u2019t take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don\u2019t want to leave so early.\nHELMER: But, my dearest Nora\u2014\nNORA: Please, Torvald dear\u2014please, please\u2014only an hour more.\nHELMER: Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing there. [He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]\nMRS LINDE: Good evening.\nNORA: Christine!\nHELMER: You here, so late, Mrs Linde?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her dress.\nNORA: Have you been sitting here waiting for me?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn\u2019t go away again without having seen you.\nHELMER: [Taking off NORA\u2019S shawl.] Yes, take a good look at her. I think she is worth looking at. Isn\u2019t she charming, Mrs Linde?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, indeed she is.\nHELMER: Doesn\u2019t she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to bring her away by force.\nNORA: Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were only for half an hour.\nHELMER: Listen to her, Mrs Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved\u2014although possibly the performance\n\nwas a trifle too realistic\u2014a little more so, I mean, than was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success\u2014she had made a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little Capri maiden\u2014my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say\u2014 on my arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and, as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought always to be effective, Mrs Linde; but that is what I cannot make Nora understand. Pooh! This room is hot. [Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door of his room.] Hullo! It\u2019s all dark in here. Oh, of course\u2014excuse me\u2014. [He goes in, and lights some candles.]\nNORA: [In a hurried and breathless whisper.] Well?\nMRS LINDE: [In a low voice.] I have had a talk with him.\nNORA: Yes, and\u2014\nMRS LINDE: Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.\nNORA: [In an expressionless voice.] I knew it.\nMRS LINDE: You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.\nNORA: I won\u2019t tell him.\nMRS LINDE: Then the letter will.\nNORA: Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush\u2014! HELMER: [Coming in again.] Well, Mrs Linde, have you admired her? MRS LINDE: Yes, and now I will say goodnight.\nHELMER: What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?\nMRS LINDE: [Taking it.] Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.\n\nHELMER: So you knit?\nMRS LINDE: Of course.\nHELMER: Do you know, you ought to embroider. MRS LINDE: Really? Why?\nHELMER: Yes, it\u2019s far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the right\u2014like this\u2014 with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?\nMRS LINDE: Yes, perhaps\u2014\nHELMER: But in the case of knitting\u2014that can never be anything but ungraceful; look here\u2014the arms close together, the knitting-needles going up and down\u2014it has a sort of Chinese effect\u2014. That was really excellent champagne they gave us.\nMRS LINDE: Well,\u2014goodnight, Nora, and don\u2019t be self-willed any more. HELMER: That\u2019s right, Mrs Linde.\nMRS LINDE: Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.\nHELMER: [Accompanying her to the door.] Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will get home all right. I should be very happy to\u2014but you haven\u2019t any great distance to go. Goodnight, goodnight. [She goes out; he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.] Ah!\u2014at last we have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.\nNORA: Aren\u2019t you very tired, Torvald? HELMER: No, not in the least.\nNORA: Nor sleepy?\nHELMER: Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And you?\u2014you really look both tired and sleepy.\n\nNORA: Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.\nHELMER: There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay there any\nlonger.\nNORA: Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.\nHELMER: [Kissing her on the forehead.] Now my little skylark is speaking reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?\nNORA: Really? Was he? I didn\u2019t speak to him at all.\nHELMER: And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in such good form. [Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.] It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with you\u2014you fascinating, charming little darling!\nNORA: Don\u2019t look at me like that, Torvald.\nHELMER: Why shouldn\u2019t I look at my dearest treasure?\u2014At all the beauty that is\nmine, all my very own?\nNORA: [Going to the other side of the table.] You mustn\u2019t say things like that to me tonight.\nHELMER: [Following her.] You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen\u2014the guests are beginning to go now. [In a lower voice.] Nora\u2014soon the whole house will be quiet.\nNORA: Yes, I hope so.\nHELMER: Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you",

[In a lower voice.] Nora\u2014soon the whole house will be quiet.\nNORA: Yes, I hope so.\nHELMER: Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?\u2014do you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.\n\nNORA: Yes, yes\u2014I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.\nHELMER: And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders\u2014on your lovely neck\u2014then I imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am bringing you for the first time into our home\u2014to be alone with you for the first time\u2014 quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer, and that was why I brought you down so early\u2014\nNORA: Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won\u2019t\u2014\nHELMER: What\u2019s that? You\u2019re joking, my little Nora! You won\u2019t\u2014you won\u2019t?\nAm I not your husband\u2014? [A knock is heard at the outer door.] NORA: [Starting.] Did you hear\u2014?\nHELMER: [Going into the hall.] Who is it?\nRANK: [Outside.] It is I. May I come in for a moment?\nHELMER: [In a fretful whisper.] Oh, what does he want now? [Aloud.] Wait a minute! [Unlocks the door.] Come, that\u2019s kind of you not to pass by our door.\nRANK: I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look in. [With a swift glance round.] Ah, yes!\u2014these dear familiar rooms. You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.\nHELMER: It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well upstairs too.\nRANK: Excellently. Why shouldn\u2019t I? Why shouldn\u2019t one enjoy everything in this world?\u2014At any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can. The wine was capital\u2014\nHELMER: Especially the champagne.\nRANK: So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I managed to\n\nput away!\nNORA: Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.\nRANK: Did he?\nNORA: Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.\nRANK: Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent day?\nHELMER: Well spent? I am afraid I can\u2019t take credit for that.\nRANK: [Clapping him on the back.] But I can, you know!\nNORA: Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific investigation today.\nRANK: Exactly.\nHELMER: Just listen!\u2014little Nora talking about scientific investigations!\nNORA: And may I congratulate you on the result?\nRANK: Indeed you may.\nNORA: Was it favourable, then?\nRANK: The best possible, for both doctor and patient\u2014certainty.\nNORA: [Quickly and searchingly.] Certainty?\nRANK: Absolute certainty. So wasn\u2019t I entitled to make a merry evening of it after that?\nNORA: Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.\nHELMER: I think so too, so long as you don\u2019t have to pay for it in the morning. RANK: Oh well, one can\u2019t have anything in this life without paying for it. NORA: Doctor Rank\u2014are you fond of fancy-dress balls?\n\nRANK: Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.\nNORA: Tell me\u2014what shall we two wear at the next?\nHELMER: Little featherbrain!\u2014Are you thinking of the next already?\nRANK: We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy\u2014\nHELMER: Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?\nRANK: Let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.\nHELMER: That was really very prettily turned. But can\u2019t you tell us what you will be?\nRANK: Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that. HELMER: Well?\nRANK: At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.\nHELMER: That\u2019s a good joke!\nRANK: There is a big black hat\u2014have you never heard of hats that make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.\nHELMER: [Suppressing a smile.] Yes, you are quite right.\nRANK: But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a cigar\u2014one\nof the dark Havanas.\nHELMER: With the greatest pleasure. [Offers him his case.] RANK: [Takes a cigar and cuts off the end.] Thanks.\nNORA: [Striking a match.] Let me give you a light.\nRANK: Thank you. [She holds the match for him to light his cigar.] And now goodbye!\n\nHELMER: Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man! NORA: Sleep well, Doctor Rank.\nRANK: Thank you for that wish.\nNORA: Wish me the same.\nRANK: You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light. [He nods to them both and goes out.]\nHELMER: [In a subdued voice.] He has drunk more than he ought.\nNORA: [Absently.] Maybe. [HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket and\ngoes into the hall.] Torvald! What are you going to do there?\nHELMER: Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room to put the\nnewspaper in tomorrow morning. NORA: Are you going to work tonight?\nHELMER: You know quite well I\u2019m not. What is this? Someone has been at the lock.\nNORA: At the lock\u2014?\nHELMER: Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought the\nmaid\u2014. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.\nNORA: [Quickly.] Then it must have been the children\u2014\nHELMER: Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have got it open. [Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.] Helen! \u2014Helen, put out the light over the front door. [Goes back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.] Look at that\u2014 look what a heap of them there are. [Turning them over.] What on earth is that?\nNORA: [At the window.] The letter\u2014No! Torvald, no!\n\nHELMER: Two cards\u2014of Rank\u2019s. NORA: Of Doctor Rank\u2019s?\nHELMER: [Looking at them.] Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have put them in when he went out.\nNORA: Is there anything written on them?\nHELMER: There is a black cross over the name. Look there\u2014what an\nuncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.\nNORA: It is just what he is doing.\nHELMER: What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to you?\nNORA: Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.\nHELMER: My poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded animal.\nNORA: If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word\u2014don\u2019t you think so, Torvald?\nHELMER: [Walking up and down.] He had so grown into our lives. I can\u2019t think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. [Standing still.] And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now. [Puts his arms round her.] My darling wife, I don\u2019t feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life\u2019s blood, and everything, for your sake.\nNORA: [Disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly.] Now you must read your letters, Torvald.\nHELMER: No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.\n\nNORA: With the thought of your friend\u2019s death\u2014\nHELMER: You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come between us\u2014the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then\u2014we will each go to our own room.\nNORA: [Hanging on his neck.] Goodnight, Torvald\u2014Goodnight!\nHELMER: [Kissing her on the forehead.] Goodnight, my little singing-bird. Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. [He takes his letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.]\nNORA: [Gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER\u2019S domino, throws it round her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers.] Never to see him again. Never! Never! [Puts her shawl over her head.] Never to see my children again either\u2014never again. Never! Never!\u2014Ah! The icy, black water\u2014the unfathomable depths\u2014If only it were over! He has got it now\u2014now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! [She is about to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand.]\nHELMER: Nora!\nNORA: Ah!\u2014\nHELMER: What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?\nNORA: Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!\nHELMER: [Holding her back.] Where are you going?\nNORA: [Trying to get free.] You shan\u2019t save me, Torvald!\nHELMER: [Reeling.] True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no\u2014it is impossible that it can be true.\nNORA: It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.\n\nHELMER: Oh, don\u2019t let us have any silly excuses.\nNORA: [Taking a step towards him.] Torvald\u2014!\nHELMER: Miserable creature\u2014what have you done?\nNORA: Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it upon yourself.\nHELMER: No tragic airs, please. [Locks the hall door.] Here you shall stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done? Answer me! Do you understand what you have done?\nNORA: [Looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face.] Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.\nHELMER: [Walking about the room.] What a horrible awakening! All these eight years\u2014she who was my joy and pride\u2014a hypocrite, a liar\u2014worse, worse\u2014a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!\u2014For shame! For shame! [NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of her.] I ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father\u2019s want of principle\u2014be silent!\u2014all your father\u2019s want of principle has come out in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty\u2014. How I am punished for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you repay me.\nNORA: Yes, that\u2019s just it.\nHELMER: Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases\u2014I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!\nNORA: When I am out of the way, you will be free.\nHELMER: No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those ready,\n\ntoo. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all\u2014that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this\u2014you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?\nNORA: [Coldly and quietly.] Yes.\nHELMER: It is so incredible that I can\u2019t take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between us were just as before\u2014but naturally only in the eyes of",

            "text": "the affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all\u2014that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this\u2014you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?\nNORA: [Coldly and quietly.] Yes.\nHELMER: It is so incredible that I can\u2019t take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between us were just as before\u2014but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still\u2014. No, that is all over. From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save the remains, the fragments, the appearance\u2014\n[A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]\nHELMER: [With a start.] What is that? So late! Can the worst\u2014? Can he\u2014? Hide\nyourself, Nora. Say you are ill.\n[NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and unlocks the hall door.]\nMAID: [Half-dressed, comes to the door.] A letter for the mistress.\nHELMER: Give it to me. [Takes the letter, and shuts the door.] Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.\nNORA: Yes, read it.\nHELMER: [Standing by the lamp.] I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. [Tears open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and gives a shout of joy.] Nora! [She\n\nlooks at him questioningly.] Nora!\u2014No, I must read it once again\u2014. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!\nNORA: And I?\nHELMER: You too, of course; we are both saved, both you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and repents\u2014that a happy change in his life\u2014never mind what he says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!\u2014No, first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see \u2014. [Takes a look at the bond.] No, no, I won\u2019t look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me. [Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove, and watches them burn.] There\u2014now it doesn\u2019t exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you\u2014. These must have been three dreadful days for you, Nora.\nNORA: I have fought a hard fight these three days.\nHELMER: And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but\u2014. No, we won\u2019t call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all over! It\u2019s all over!\u201d Listen to me, Nora. You don\u2019t seem to realise that it is all over. What is this?\u2014such a cold, set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don\u2019t feel as if you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did out of love for me.\nNORA: That is true.\nHELMER: You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don\u2019t understand how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes. You must not think anymore about the hard things I said in my first moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have\n\nforgiven you.\nNORA: Thank you for your forgiveness. [She goes out through the door to the\nright.]\nHELMER: No, don\u2019t go\u2014. [Looks in.] What are you doing in there? NORA: [From within.] Taking off my fancy dress.\nHELMER: [Standing at the open door.] Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. [Walks up and down by the door.] How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk\u2019s claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won\u2019t need me to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true man\u2019s heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his wife\u2014forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I will serve as will and conscience both to you\u2014. What is this? Not gone to bed? Have you changed your things?\nNORA: [In everyday dress.] Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now. HELMER: But what for?\u2014so late as this.\nNORA: I shall not sleep tonight.\nHELMER: But, my dear Nora\u2014\n\nNORA: [Looking at her watch.] It is not so very late. Sit down here, Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. [She sits down at one side of the table.]\nHELMER: Nora\u2014what is this?\u2014this cold, set face?\nNORA: Sit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with you.\nHELMER: [Sits down at the opposite side of the table.] You alarm me, Nora!\u2014 and I don\u2019t understand you.\nNORA: No, that is just it. You don\u2019t understand me, and I have never understood you either\u2014before tonight. No, you mustn\u2019t interrupt me. You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of accounts.\nHELMER: What do you mean by that?\nNORA: [After a short silence.] Isn\u2019t there one thing that strikes you as strange in\nour sitting here like this?\nHELMER: What is that?\nNORA: We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have had a serious conversation?\nHELMER: What do you mean by serious?\nNORA: In all these eight years\u2014longer than that\u2014from the very beginning of our\nacquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any serious subject.\nHELMER: Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear?\nNORA: I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.\nHELMER: But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?\nNORA: That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly\n\nwronged, Torvald\u2014first by papa and then by you.\nHELMER: What! By us two\u2014by us two, who have loved you better than anyone else in the world?\nNORA: [Shaking her head.] You have never loved me. You have only thought it pleasant to be in love with me.\nHELMER: Nora, what do I hear you saying?\nNORA: It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you\u2014\nHELMER: What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?\nNORA: [Undisturbed.] I mean that I was simply transferred from papa\u2019s hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same tastes as yours, else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which\u2014I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman\u2014just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.\nHELMER: How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?\nNORA: No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never really been so.\nHELMER: Not\u2014not happy!\nNORA: No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I\n\nwas papa\u2019s doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.\nHELMER: There is some truth in what you say\u2014exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.\nNORA: Whose lessons? Mine, or the children\u2019s?\nHELMER: Both yours and the children\u2019s, my darling Nora.\nNORA: Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a proper wife for you.\nHELMER: And you can say that!\nNORA: And I\u2014how am I fitted to bring up the children?\nHELMER: Nora!\nNORA: Didn\u2019t you say so yourself a little while ago\u2014that you dare not trust me to bring them up?\nHELMER: In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?\nNORA: Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate myself\u2014you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.\nHELMER: [Springing up.] What do you say?\nNORA: I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and everything\nabout me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you any longer.\nHELMER: Nora, Nora!\nNORA: I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will take me\n\nin for the night\u2014\nHELMER: You are out of your mind! I won\u2019t allow it! I forbid you!\nNORA: It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or later.\nHELMER: What sort of madness is this!\nNORA: Tomorrow I shall go home\u2014I mean, to my old home. It will be easiest for\nme to find something to do there.\nHELMER: You blind, foolish woman!\nNORA: I must try and get some sense, Torvald.\nHELMER: To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you don\u2019t consider what people will say!\nNORA: I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary for me.\nHELMER: It\u2019s shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred duties.\nNORA: What do you consider my most sacred duties?\nHELMER: Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your husband and your children?\nNORA: I have other duties just as sacred.\nHELMER: That you have not. What duties could those be? NORA: Duties to myself.\nHELMER: Before all else, you are a wife and a mother.\nNORA: I don\u2019t believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you are\u2014or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people would think you right,\n\nand that views of that kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get to understand them.\nHELMER: Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as that?\u2014have you no religion?\nNORA: I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.\nHELMER: What are you saying?\nNORA: I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if it",

I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if it is true for me.\nHELMER: This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you have some moral sense? Or\u2014answer me\u2014am I to think you have none?\nNORA: I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I really don\u2019t know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her husband\u2019s life. I can\u2019t believe that.\nHELMER: You talk like a child. You don\u2019t understand the conditions of the world in which you live.\nNORA: No,Idon\u2019t.ButnowIamgoingtotry.IamgoingtoseeifIcanmakeout who is right, the world or I.\nHELMER: You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out of your mind.\nNORA: I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.\n\nHELMER: And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your husband and your children?\nNORA: Yes, it is.\nHELMER: Then there is only one possible explanation.\nNORA: What is that?\nHELMER: You do not love me anymore.\nNORA: No, that is just it.\nHELMER: Nora!\u2014and you can say that?\nNORA: It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.\nHELMER: [Regaining his composure.] Is that a clear and certain conviction too? NORA: Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will not stay\nhere any longer.\nHELMER: And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?\nNORA: Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.\nHELMER: Explain yourself better. I don\u2019t understand you.\nNORA: I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don\u2019t happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad\u2019s letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent to accept this man\u2019s conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that was done\u2014\nHELMER: Yes, what then?\u2014when I had exposed my wife to shame and disgrace?\n\nNORA: When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.\nHELMER: Nora\u2014!\nNORA: You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.\nHELMER: I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora\u2014bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.\nNORA: It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.\nHELMER: Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.\nNORA: Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over\u2014and it was not fear for what threatened me, but for what might happen to you\u2014when the whole thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because it was so brittle and fragile. [Getting up.] Torvald\u2014 it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange man, and had borne him three children\u2014. Oh, I can\u2019t bear to think of it! I could tear myself into little bits!\nHELMER: [Sadly.] I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us\u2014there is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?\nNORA: As I am now, I am no wife for you.\nHELMER: I have it in me to become a different man.\nNORA: Perhaps\u2014if your doll is taken away from you.\nHELMER: But to part!\u2014to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can\u2019t understand that\n\nidea.\nNORA: [Going out to the right.] That makes it all the more certain that it must be done. [She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.]\nHELMER: Nora, Nora, not now! Wait until tomorrow.\nNORA: [Putting on her cloak.] I cannot spend the night in a strange man\u2019s room. HELMER: But can\u2019t we live here like brother and sister\u2014?\nNORA: [Putting on her hat.] You know very well that would not last long. [Puts the shawl round her.] Goodbye, Torvald. I won\u2019t see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I can be of no use to them.\nHELMER: But some day, Nora\u2014some day?\nNORA: How can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me. HELMER: But you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.\nNORA: Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her husband\u2019s house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.\nHELMER: That too? NORA: That too. HELMER: Here it is.\nNORA: That\u2019s right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here. The maids know all about everything in the house\u2014better than I do. Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after me.\n\nHELMER: All over! All over!\u2014Nora, shall you never think of me again? NORA: I know I shall often think of you, the children, and this house. HELMER: May I write to you, Nora?\nNORA: No\u2014never. You must not do that.\nHELMER: But at least let me send you\u2014\nNORA: Nothing\u2014nothing\u2014\nHELMER: Let me help you if you are in want.\nNORA: No. I can receive nothing from a stranger.\nHELMER: Nora\u2014can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?\nNORA: [Taking her bag.] Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all would have to happen.\nHELMER: Tell me what that would be!\nNORA: Both you and I would have to be so changed that\u2014. Oh, Torvald, I don\u2019t\nbelieve any longer in wonderful things happening.\nHELMER: But I will believe in it. Tell me! So changed that\u2014?\nNORA: That our life together would be a real wedlock. Goodbye. [She goes out through the hall.]\nHELMER: [Sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands.] Nora! Nora! [Looks round, and rises.] Empty. She is gone. [A hope flashes across his mind.] The most wonderful thing of all\u2014?\n[The sound of a door shutting is heard from below.]",
